		Firmware dated August 23 2016 and after have the capability of getting

		This page will show you how you can select the proper IP address so that 
		the NTP function can get the time from the NTP server of your choice.&nbsp; 
		There are mainly two options.&nbsp; From your local computer, or from a 
		Time server on the internet.&nbsp; For the links on this page to 
		function, your Gemini-2 must be turned on, and it must be able to access 
		the internet.&nbsp; It also must accept "NetBios" commands for 
		http//gemini/ to work instead of http://IP address. In other words you 
		must be able to see the Gemini 2's Web page with a web browser by typing 
		http://gemini/<br /><br /></td>
