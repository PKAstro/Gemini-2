		<ul>
			<li>Power Supply Voltage - This bar graph shows the external power being supplied to the Gemini-2.  It will turn Yellow, and then Red if the power supply voltage is not high enough.  Note that the Internal Processor has code that will try and save the current setting, but stop motor movement if the power supply drops too low.&nbsp; 
			<em>Remember this is just a demo page, use the link at the bottom to see 
			the real value.</em></li>
			<li>Lithium Battery Voltage - This is the bar graph of the internal 
			Lithium battery.&nbsp; This battery is used to back up the internal 
			SRam and Clock circuits.&nbsp; Without it, the Gemini-2 would not 
			remember much of the current setting, and they would have to be 
			reprogrammed upon power up.&nbsp; The internal battery is a CR2354.
			<em>Remember this is just a demo page, use the link at the bottom to see 
			the real value.</em></li>
			
			<li>PIN Status - This is the pin status of all the external ports on 
			the Gemini-2<ul>
				<li>HC buttons - These are the buttons on the
				<a href="images/HC.jpg">Classic hand controller</a>, that can be 
				plugged into the Classic hand controller jack.&nbsp; This hand 
				controller can be purchased from Losmandy. It is on there
				<a href="http://www.losmandy.com/replacement.html" target="_blank">
				replacement parts web page.</a>&nbsp; I really recommend it.&nbsp; 
				It can also be used to test the Guider inputs.</li>
				<li>Use the Periodic check box to have these inputs show up as 
				they are activated. Otherwise you will have to use the Refresh 
				button to try and catch them.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Port E Usage - This port has several usages:<ul>
				<li>Ignore/off - pretty much means what it says.&nbsp; This port 
				is not monitored.</li>
				<li>Axis Encoders - This would use external encoders if plugged 
				into this port and this selection selected. The only problem 
				with this is that the Firmware in the Gemini-2 does not at this 
				time use the external encoder values, as the ones sold by 
				Losmandy has a much lower resolution than the ones on the back 
				of the motors.&nbsp; This cause the Gemini-2 to loose accuracy 
				if the external encoders are use.</li>
				<li>End Switches -&nbsp; If this is selected, then any one of 
				the pins 1, 3, 5, 7 if taken to ground (shorted to pin 8) will 
				stop all motor movement in both RA and DEC.&nbsp; Note that 
				these pins are +3.3V inputs Max, and supplying more than that 
				could damage the internal ARM processor.&nbsp; These pins need 
				to be pulled up to +3.3v through&nbsp; 1K resistors for each 
				input. </li>
				<li>The +5V pins on this jack was intended to supply power to 
				external encoders.&nbsp; Do not use this voltage to provide 
				pull-up voltage for the inputs of this jack.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Port F Pins - These check boxes are used to activate the 
			associated pin, so that it can be used.&nbsp; If the checkbox is not 
			checked, that input pin is not used. </li>
