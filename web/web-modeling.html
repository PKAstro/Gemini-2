			<li>Manage Current Model:<ul>
				<li>Reset model - this will reset the model to zero - Note it

				<li>Undo Last Alignment - this will remove the last alignment

			<li>Change current model:<ul>
				<li>Align - this will add the current point in space - using the 
				last known star to the model and compute parameters.</li>
				<li>Synchronize - This will align the model to the current 
				pointing position without modifying the model parameters.&nbsp; 
				If a model is built, and you are doing a warm start, you would 
				center on a star and then do a Synchronize.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Model Parameters:&nbsp; Use the Select model to select which 
			side you will see.<ul>
				<li>Alignment count - tells you how many points are in the 
				model. </li>
				<li>Polar Axis Misalignment - can be calculated with 3 to 5 stars.&nbsp; 
				Values are in arcsec.</li>
				<li>Orthogonally Error - This is calculated with the 6 through 9 
				stars. Values are in arcsec.</li>
				<li>Flexure - this is calculated with 10+ stars. Values are in 
				arcsec.</li>

			<li>Manage Models on SDcard:<ul>
				<li>Store model on SDcard - store current model in use to SDcard. 
				This is stored in the Model Subdirectory in the format of 
				Model-Year-month-day_Time-Local.bin.</li>
				<li>Load a model from SDcard - you can select any model stored 
				of the SDcard and have the current one replaced with it.</li>
				<li>Delete a model on the SDcard -&nbsp; you can delete any 
				model stored on the SDcard. Note that when you delete a stored 
				model, that the model parameters will jump to that deleted 
				model. to get the current model back, you will have to use Load 
				a model from SDcard.</li>
