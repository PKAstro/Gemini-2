		<td class="style6-red-text">Please note that the GPS 
				supplied by Losmandy for the Gemini-1 will not work on the 
				Gemini-2.&nbsp; It can be modified by cutting off the connectors 
				and putting on the correct ones.&nbsp; You can find the 
				instruction on the Gemini-2 Users group in message
				<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Gemini-II/message/155" target="_blank"> 155.</a>
				I take no responsibility and you do this 
				modification at your own risk.&nbsp; I don't have either 
				version, so no instruction are given here, and I cannot and have 
				not tested the modifications.&nbsp; I use the GPS sold by S<a href="http://www.stargps.ca/" target="_blank" >targps</a>.with 
				the proper adapter for the Gemini-2.Â  They have just released a 
		new 65 channel unit called the NX-02.&nbsp; Make sure you order the 
		Gemini-2 adapter with it.&nbsp; With this unit, it has to be powered up 
		for 45 seconds before it will switch to the NEMA mode.</td>
