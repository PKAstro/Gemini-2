		<td width="900px" class="style6">
		There are 4 ways to update the firmware in the Gemini 2 controller. 
		All methods require an Ethernet connection between your computer and the 
		Gemini-2. This also includes removing the micro-SDcards and programming 
		them directly.&nbsp; 
		If for no other reason, it is required to tell the Web interface to 
		flash the program into the ARM processor.&nbsp; But for the other FTP methods 
		Ethernet is also required to transfer all the files.&nbsp; If you don't have an Ethernet connection see
		<a href="ConnectingtoG2.html" target="_self">
		http://gemini-2.com/ConnectingtoG2.php</a><br />
		All updated files are listed at the bottom of this page.&nbsp; Other 
		web pages may have them listed also, but the links at the bottom of this 
		page should be the most current.<br /><br />
		<p>The four methods are:
		<ol>
			<li>Use the new <a href="gfu.html" target="_self">Firmware Update program for Windows</a>, that can update everything, 
		just the main unit, catalog files, or the new video files.&nbsp; This is now the recommended 
		method.&nbsp; This routine updates the Gemini-2 almost twice as fast as most of the FTP methods.</li>
			<li><a name="The_FTP_Methods">The FTP Methods
		</a>are divided into two methods, 
		according to which FTP method you use.&nbsp; The FTP methods are for advanced users, that understand how the 
		firmware and directory structure of the micro-SDCards works, and how to 
		use a computer.&nbsp; Use a FTP 
		method to program both the Main unit and Graphics Hand controller at the 
		same time. You either use an FTP client such as
		<a href="http://download.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_3.7.3_win32-setup.exe" target="_blank">
		Filezilla Client</a>, or Windows File Explorer. (put
		ftp://admin@Gemini or
		ftp://admin@192.168.0.111 if using Windows File Explorer.)&nbsp; 
		Note if your IP address for the Gemini-2 is different then use that.
		<br />
		Use a FTP program (Recommended when more than one file is being 
		updated, or rebuilding the main units micro-SDcard file 
				structure.) Again this is only for Advanced user that 
				understand the directory and file structure of the micro-SDcards. Only firmware dated after 9 April 
		2011 has the FTP 
				capability build in.</li>
			<li>Use the Web interface.&nbsp; (Recommended when gemhc.bin or 
				NewGem.bin/gemhc.bin is the only files being updated.)&nbsp; You can 
		only update one file at a time using this method.&nbsp; This 
		method requires you to use the SD Card tab of the web interface.&nbsp; 
		You use the "Upload a file to the SD card's current directory"&nbsp; If 
		uploading the NewGem.bin file you do that to the root of the SDcard.&nbsp; 
		If uploading GemHC.bin (hand controller programing file) you first 
		select the HCFirmware directory and then do the upload.&nbsp; If 
		uploading a catalog file to the hand controller you also select the 
		HCFirmware directory. If the uploaded file was NewGem.bin, then you will 
		have to go into the web interface, Firmware/SRAM tab and flash this file 
		into the ARM processor for it to do any update.</li>
			<li>Remove the micro-SDcards, format &amp; program them and 
				reinstall them. If your 
				Hand Controller firmware is before Jan 31,2011, and your main 
				unit firmware is before April 9 2011 then you might have to use this 
				method. After that the Update program in Paragraph 1 
				(recommended) or FTP method should work.
				It is the method you might have to use if your SDcards gets corrupted.&nbsp; 
		This is always the fall back method if something goes wrong, to try and 
		recover either the main unit or the hand controller. see
		<a href="Removing_SDCards.html" target="_self">
		http://gemini-2.com/Removing_SDCards.php</a> <br />
		
		<br /> <span class="style2">If you have to format the SD card it is best to download the official 
				SDcard format routine from the</span>
		<a href="https://www.sdcard.org/" target="_blank">https://www.sdcard.org</a>

		NOTES:
		1. The Hand Controller is updated using a file called gemhc.bin, 
			and can be done from the main Gemini 2 unit using either the Web 
			interface or the FTP method. Putting the gemhc.bin file in a 
			subdirectory called HCFirmware will upload it to the hand controller 
			from the main Gemini 2 unit. Please note that there are now 38 (as of 
		August 2013) button files that also have to be uploaded to update the 
		Hand controller.&nbsp; Please note that the Gemini MUST BE THROUGH 
			THE BOOT MENU for this to work. Also any catalog (.GUC file) can be 
			uploaded to the hand controller the same way.<br /><br />
		2. The Main Gemini unit's 
		ARM processor is updated using a file called NewGem.bin. But there are 
		many files in up to 30 sub-directories, that support it.&nbsp; Not all 
		have to be present, but the EN directory is a must for the English 
		language.&nbsp; The Gemini-2 creates some of these directories itself, 
		such as LOGS, CONFIG, PEC, and MODELS.<br /><br />
		
		3.	Both micro-SDcards (the one in the Hand Controller, and the one 
			in the Main Gemini 2) also contain many other files.&nbsp; These 
			other files can be put on the 
			
			Main Gemini 2 unit with a 
				FTP program, or
				one at a time with the web interface, or
				by removing the 
			card and putting the files on it with a card reader/writer, and the reinstalling 
			the card. There are 2 ways to do this with the Hand Controller files, 
				
					use a card reader/writer 
			on the micro-SDcard in the Hand controller, or 
					put the files in the HCFirmware directory of the main micro-SDcard directory.  This is normally a one time thing, 
			as most of the files on the Hand Controller mini-SDcard are the Star 
			Catalogs and button files which seldom change if ever. <br /><br />
