		<td width="900px" class="style6">
		There are 4 ways to update the firmware in the Gemini 2 controller. 
		All methods require an Ethernet connection between your computer and the 
		Gemini-2. This also includes removing the micro-SDcards and programming 
		them directly.&nbsp; 
		If for no other reason, it is required to tell the Web interface to 
		flash the program into the ARM processor.&nbsp; But for the other FTP methods 
		Ethernet is also required to transfer all the files.&nbsp; If you don't have an Ethernet connection see
		<a href="ConnectingtoG2.html" target="_self">
		http://gemini-2.net/ConnectingtoG2.php</a><br />
		All updated files are listed at the bottom of this page.&nbsp; Other 
		web pages may have them listed also, but the links at the bottom of this 
		page should be the most current.<br /><br />The four methods are:<br />
		1. Use the new <a href="gfu.html" target="_blank">Firmware Update program for Windows</a>, <!-- or the <a href="gfu_mac.html" target="_blank">Firmware Update program for Mac</a>--> that can update everything, 
		just the main unit, catalog files, or the new video files.&nbsp; This is now the recommended 
		method.&nbsp; This routine updates the Gemini-2 almost twice as fast as most of the FTP methods.<br />
		<br />
			2. <a name="The_FTP_Methods">The FTP Methods
		</a>are divided into two methods, 
		according to which FTP method you use.&nbsp; The FTP methods are for advanced users, that understand how the 
		firmware and directory structure of the micro-SDCards works, and how to 
		use a computer.&nbsp; Use a FTP 
		method to program both the Main unit and Graphics Hand controller at the 
		same time. You either use an FTP client such as
		<a href="http://download.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_3.7.3_win32-setup.exe" target="_blank">
		Filezilla Client</a>, or Windows File Explorer. (put
		ftp://admin@Gemini or
		ftp://admin@192.168.0.111 if using Windows File Explorer.)&nbsp; 
		Note if your IP address for the Gemini-2 is different then use that.
		<br />
		Use a FTP program (Recommended when more than one file is being 
		updated, or rebuilding the main units micro-SDcard file 
				structure.) Again this is only for Advanced user that 
				understand the directory and file structure of the micro-SDcards. Only firmware dated after 9 April 
		2011 has the FTP 
				capability build in.<br />
		
		<ul>

			downloads, extracts the files to C:\gemini2, and opens up two Windows Explorer Panes for you. It will only work

			on some XP systems, not some XP systems.</li> -->

<table align="center" style="width: 900px">
	<tr>
		<td class="style6">
		3. Use the Web interface.&nbsp; (Recommended when gemhc.bin or 
				NewGem.bin/gemhc.bin is the only files being updated.)&nbsp; You can 
		only update one file at a time using this method.&nbsp; This 
		method requires you to use the SD Card tab of the web interface.&nbsp; 
		You use the "Upload a file to the SD card's current directory"&nbsp; If 
		uploading the NewGem.bin file you do that to the root of the SDcard.&nbsp; 
		If uploading GemHC.bin (hand controller programing file) you first 
		select the HCFirmware directory and then do the upload.&nbsp; If 
		uploading a catalog file to the hand controller you also select the 
		HCFirmware directory. If the uploaded file was NewGem.bin, then you will 
		have to go into the web interface, Firmware/SRAM tab and flash this file 
		into the ARM processor for it to do any update.<br />
		<br />
		 <hr class="auto-style1" style="width: 900px" noshade="noshade" />
		 <br />
		<br />
		4. Remove the micro-SDcards, format &amp; program them and 
				reinstall them. If your 
				Hand Controller firmware is before Jan 31,2011, and your main 
				unit firmware is before April 9 2011 then you might have to use this 
				method. After that the Update program in Paragraph 1 
				(recommended) or FTP method should work.
				It is the method you might have to use if your SDcards gets corrupted.&nbsp; 
		This is always the fall back method if something goes wrong, to try and 
		recover either the main unit or the hand controller. see
		<a href="Removing_SDCards.html" target="_self">
		http://gemini-2.net/Removing_SDCards.php</a> <br />
		
		<br /> <span class="style2">If you have to format the SD card it is best to download the official 
				SDcard format routine from the</span>
		<a href="https://www.sdcard.org/" target="_blank">https://www.sdcard.org</a>
		<span class="style2">download section.</span><br /><br />
		<hr class="auto-style1" noshade="noshade" style="width: 900px; height: 4px" /><br />
			
		NOTES:
		1. The Hand Controller is updated using a file called gemhc.bin, 
			and can be done from the main Gemini 2 unit using either the Web 
			interface or the FTP method. Putting the gemhc.bin file in a 
			subdirectory called HCFirmware will upload it to the hand controller 
			from the main Gemini 2 unit. Please note that there are now 38 (as of 
		August 2013) button files that also have to be uploaded to update the 
		Hand controller.&nbsp; Please note that the Gemini MUST BE THROUGH 
			THE BOOT MENU for this to work. Also any catalog (.GUC file) can be 
			uploaded to the hand controller the same way.<br /><br />
		2. The Main Gemini unit's 
		ARM processor is updated using a file called NewGem.bin. But there are 
		many files in up to 30 sub-directories, that support it.&nbsp; Not all 
		have to be present, but the EN directory is a must for the English 
		language.&nbsp; The Gemini-2 creates some of these directories itself, 
		such as LOGS, CONFIG, PEC, and MODELS.<br /><br />
		
		3.	Both micro-SDcards (the one in the Hand Controller, and the one 
			in the Main Gemini 2) also contain many other files.&nbsp; These 
			other files can be put on the 
			
			Main Gemini 2 unit with a 
				FTP program, or
				one at a time with the web interface, or
				by removing the 
			card and putting the files on it with a card reader/writer, and the reinstalling 
			the card. There are 2 ways to do this with the Hand Controller files, 
				
					use a card reader/writer 
			on the micro-SDcard in the Hand controller, or 
					put the files in the HCFirmware directory of the main micro-SDcard directory.  This is normally a one time thing, 
			as most of the files on the Hand Controller mini-SDcard are the Star 
			Catalogs and button files which seldom change if ever. <br /><br />

		Note that normally 
		the below available files are to do updates 
			with. They are supplied in Zip format&nbsp; and will need to be unzipped:&nbsp; 
		The combined.zip file contains all the other files listed below and is in the proper 
		Directory/File Structure for the main units micro SDcard.&nbsp; It will 
		update both the main unit and hand controller files except the Catalogs 
		of the Hand Controller.&nbsp; GFU can be used to install most of the 
		below files.&nbsp; <br />

					<li>
					<a href="http://www.gemini-2.net/firmware1/current/catalogs.zip" target="_blank">Catalogs.zip</a> - these are the catalogs files for upload

					separate process to the hand controller.&nbsp; They can be 
					directly written to the mico-SDcard in the hand controller 
					using a card reader/writer, or they can be put into the 
					HCFirmware directory of the micro-SDcard in the main unit.&nbsp; 
					The main unit will then upload them to the hand controller.&nbsp;

					network as the Gemini-2.&nbsp; If you have a laptop or 
					tablet 
					connected to the Gemini-2 then you can see them in it's web 
					browser.&nbsp; They are there mainly for ones who go into 
					the field and have no web connectivity. The directory for 
					these manuals is "Manual" and is placed at the root of the 
					micro-SDcard in the main unit.&nbsp; They are part of the 
					combined.zip file so normally do not need to be downloaded 
					as a separate item.&nbsp; The Manual directory is the 
					largest directory approaching almost 14 megabytes of 
					directories and files. This directory takes about a half 
					hour or more to upload using a FTP process into the 
					Gemini-2. If you don't need them, then I suggest you delete 
					this directory from the Combined.zip files after unzipping 
					it.&nbsp; It will save you allot of time.&nbsp; If you are 
					using a card reader/writer, then the size really does not 
					matter, so leave them in place.&nbsp; The choice is yours.&nbsp; 
					GFU can be used to upload these files.&nbsp; Uncheck HC, 
					Catalogs and Flash, Check Gemini.<br /><br /></li> -->
