Gemini-II web interface
-----------------------
Rev. 0.91 - March 27, 2011


1. Introduction

Gemini's internal web server accesses files on the SD card. Only very few pages, like an initial index.htm and error pages are held in the code. This gives the user the possibility to customize the web interface at will. He can put static files on the SD card (HTML, JPEG, PNG, ...) if the browser can interpret them correctly. 

Important to find the files is their location. Currently Gemini's web server supports three languages: English, German and French. For these languages, directories EN, DE and FR exists on the SD card, which contain the web pages in the respective languages.

Whenever a web page is requested, the web server examines the language code in the HTTP header the browser sent according to its setup, changes to the directory (or defaults to EN if the language is not (yet) supported and tries to open the file. If this is successful and the file name extension does not mark it as a dynamic html file, the file content is transmitted to the browser.

All commands and parameters described below are case sensitive!


2. Dynamic .cgi files
2.1. Format description

These files are analyzed and interpreted line by line. A line must not exceed 120 characters. 
Each line starts with a character describing how to to interpret it:

'#'	A hash mark tells the interpreter to ignore this line
't'	Text. The line will be sent to the browser without any changes
'i'	This line will be replaced by the file with the given name included,
'c'	This line will be interpreted, the output will be dynamically build. 
'.'	End of file.

Lines starting with the character 'c' will have some more characters following determining how to interpret them. The second character will be ignored, the third character will be used for the first and most important selection. Depending on this, the fifth character may be used as a secondary choice.

Dynamic files are examined and the returned content is generated at runtime. If you don't want to build your own .cgi-file, there's a dummy file "command.cgi" included in the Gemini firmware image, that allows to work with the parameters given below.

2.3 Serial Port Emulator
This emulator bridges the gap between the HTTP-based web interface and the serial command. Commands sent as string value of the SE= parameter are executed by the serial command interpreter. It is possible to send several serial commands at once, but it must be assured that the responses not exceed 64 byte, the length of a special output buffer for the interpreter. This output can be obtained with the cgi command line "c C S %s".



2.4 Forms input
2.4.1 POST parameter

Only used for file uploading and SD card formating so far.

2.4.2 GET parameter

Syntax:

Sometimes the command strings don't need and examine parameter values given (nothing noted after the equal sign), but most commands need them formed exactly as described below in C-printf syntax:

%d	integer
%u	unsigned integer
%f	floating point number
%s	string

All other characters have to appear exactly as they are shown.

3. Character encoding

Gemini-II supports internationalized messages. Special characters have to be displayed by the HC, browsers as well as they have to be exchanged between browser. 

Several characters can be encoded in ISO/IEC 8859 form, f.i. the German and French characters. 

The graphical HC supports XML encoded Greek lowercase characters:
alpha	&#945;
beta	&#946;
gamma	&#947;
delta	&#948;
epsilon	&#949;
... until ...
omega	&#969;

The HC also supports the common German anf French special characters.
