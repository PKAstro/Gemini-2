This adapter is based on the FTDI chipset, and is powered by the Gemini on the Gemini side of the adapter and the USB port of your computer on the USB side of the adapter.  This adapter provides an isolated magnetically coupled communications path between the Gemini and your computer that consists of 256 byte receive buffer, and a 128 byte transmit buffer.  This enables better communications and less data loss than most of the USB to Serial adapters that must be used with the newer laptops  that don't have serial ports. Drivers are available for just about any computer operating in use today, except DOS.  <br><br>    The use of this adapter can help prevent ground loops between the Gemini and you computer.
