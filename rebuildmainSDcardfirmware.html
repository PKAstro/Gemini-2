                updating the SDCard directory; or your&nbsp; Firmware version is dated Dec 13 2011 or older.&nbsp; This will also update the firmware in the handcontroller at the same time.&nbsp; <span class="auto-style2">
			If you intend to update the hand controllers micro-SDcard using a

                <br/> Since you are rebuilding the SDCard, I am going to suggest that you format the card. This will remove any file corruption on the SDCard. If the card is 2GB card you can use the default Windows format size. If the Card is 4GB you
                need to select FAT32 from the format size window. I suggest that you download and install
                <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/" target="_blank">
			SDFormatter.</a>&nbsp; When you open this program after installing it, it should automatically show your micro-SDcard. <br />

                <br /> 5. Now rename the NewGem.bin File to HGM_Gem2.bin The Gemini-2 will perform an automatic flash when Powered on. This is necessary because the really old firmware cannot Flash NewGem.bin from the web interface.
                <br /><br /> 6. Now copy the complete file structure from the Gemini directory (if that is what you used) onto the micro_SDcard. You should have a similar directory to Fig 4 below.</td>

                back on. After the initial screen, the Hand controller should tell you that it is updating firmware, then go into the Flashing&nbsp; firmware message.&nbsp; This takes about 5&nbsp; to over 30 minutes if you are doing a complete update
                of the hand controller.&nbsp; If everything is good, you will see a new screen offering 3 selections. They are "Polar Align Assist", "Assistance in building a model", and "Tour a catalog".&nbsp; You can use any of these, or use the back
                button to get to the observation/setup screen.&nbsp; On the Setup --&gt;Mount, you can change the default boot method if you desire, from "cold start" to "ask if possible" (just a suggestion)<br />
                <br /> 11. You should be done.&nbsp; Note: the pictures above shows a Jul 22, 2015 main unit firmware date.&nbsp; It is totally possible that&nbsp; a newer version has just been posted since I wrote these instructions.<br /> &nbsp;
