                <br>INDI Library (<a href="https://www.indilib.org/" target="_blank">https://www.indilib.org</a>) is a cross-platform, cross-operating system library for operating various astronomical devices. INDI Library currently support Linux, BSD and OSX systems. 
                <br><br>wINDI (3rd party software) is a complete .NET implementation of the INDI protocol and is available natively on Windows. 

<br><br>INDI is open source, released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL v2+). This means that any user can use and modify the source code to their own needs. It also means that it is free (no cost)

<br><br>INDI supports Gemini and Gemini-2 devices and allows them to be used from other software, such as Kstars/Ekos, Sky Chart, Sky Safari, PHD2, PixInsight,  etc.

<br><br>The purpose of INDI is very similar to that of the ASCOM platform and ASCOM drivers designed for Windows, but INDI is designed to also run on other devices, such as Raspberry Pi, Apple Mac, etc. Please note that INDI and ASCOM standards are currently not compatible, so one can't be just replaced with the other, unless your astro software supports both.

<br><br>INDI forms the infrastructure for Kstars/Ekos, which is a full featured system for telescope control and image capture. 

<br><br>A more complete list of software that supports INDI is located at INDILIB.ORG site:<a href="https://www.indilib.org/about/clients.html" target="_blank">https://www.indilib.org/about/clients.html</a>
