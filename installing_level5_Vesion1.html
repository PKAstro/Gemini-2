			<a name="nr">NEW-RELEASE</a>: Please note that a new release of the 
				hand controller and main firmware has has been released. If you 
				already installed the Aug 27, 2013 firmware with the&nbsp; Aug 27 
				Hand controller firmware, there is no reason to reinstall most 
				of the firmware. You just need to install the Oct 25 NewGem.bin and Sept 
				30 gemhc.bin files to be up-to-date.&nbsp;&nbsp; This fixes the PAA, Identify 
			and Bookmark functions.&nbsp; 
			Also, the tactical buttons have been activated for the balance 
			screen and also the set limits screen in the hand controller.&nbsp; To install it,
			<a href="firmware1/NewGem-gem-hd-3-Oct-2013.html" target="_self">download the file.</a>&nbsp; Then unzip it to a clean directory,&nbsp; 
			It contains both files listed above. &nbsp; Upload the gemhc.bin file into the Gemini-2 into the HCFirmware directory.&nbsp; You can do 
			the with FileZilla, Windows File Manager (use
			<a href="ftp://admin@gemini/">ftp://admin@gemini</a>) or the web 
			interface&nbsp; using the SDcard Tab <a href="http://gemini/sd.cgi">
			http://gemini/sd.cgi</a> upload feature. If using the web interface, 
			after clicking on the SDcard tab, single click on HCFirmware 
			directory the use the browse and send buttons to upload the file.&nbsp; 
			After it is uploaded, unplug the hand controller and plug it back 
			in.&nbsp; This will cause it to upload into the hand controller, and 
			be flashed into the processor. After the hand controller is updated, 
			use the same process but put the NewGem.bin file at the root of the 
			SCcard, not in any directory. Then go to the Firmware/SRAM tab and 
			select the Newgem.bin file and then Flash it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			After this is done, turn off the Gemini-2 and back on to synchronize 
			the hand controller and main unit.&nbsp; These updates is already included in the combine file 
			after Oct 25, 2013, so if you do the full upgrade, you will get the 
			latest firmware.&nbsp; If you did the firmware updates on the 
			page prior to Oct 25, 2013, then you only need to follow the 
			instructions in the paragraph. Here is a small
			<a href="Newgem-gemhx-only/Newgem-gemhc-only.html" target="_self">
