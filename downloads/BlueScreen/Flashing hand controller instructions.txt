1.) Install FlashMagic.
2.) Unzip hc_bl.zip where you want to have stored. you get the .hex file.
3.) Open the HC cover plate. If you like to experiment: J1 ("Boot") 
is on the left side, the single jumper. It has to be closed at powering 
up to active the ARM boot loader. The usual way is to put a jumper on it. 
For this I'd suggest you screw the display off (1/16" Allen wrench). 
Dont forget to put the display back in place.
4.) Connect the Gemini serial adapter cable to the HC and, over the 
DB-9 null-modem adapter, to your PC.
5.) Set the PC serial port to 115,8,n,1 bps, no handshake.
6.) Power the display by connecting the miniUSB port at the top to 
your PC's USB port. This is the moment where J1 must be closed.
7.) Start FlashMagic and set it up according to the screenshot. 
Don't check "Fill unused Flash" or you would erase the HC code. 
Point to the hc_bl.hex file and press "Start"
8.) If it worked, remove the jumper... if not, check the 
settings and cycle the display power. If there is an 
"Autobaud failure" message, your cabling is not correct.
