Gemini-II web interface
-----------------------
Rev. 1.04 - Jul 22, 2015


1. Introduction

Gemini's internal web server searches the files requested by the HTTP URLs first on the SD card. Only very few pages, like an initial index.htm, sd.cgi and error pages are stored hard-coded in the firmware as a fallback if the SD card is empty, freshly formatted or faulty. This gives the user the possibility to customize the web interface at will. He can put static files on the SD card (HTML, JPEG, PNG, ...) if the browser can interpret them correctly. 

Important to find the files is their location. Currently Gemini's web server supports four languages: English, German, French and Spanish. For these languages, directories EN, DE, FR and ES exist on the SD card, which contain the web pages in the respective languages.

Whenever a web page is requested, the web server examines the language code in the HTTP header the browser sent according to its setup, changes to the directory (or defaults to EN if the language is not (yet) supported and tries to open the file. If this is successful and the file name extension does not mark it as a dynamic HTML file, the file content is transmitted to the browser.

All commands and parameters described below are case sensitive!


2. Dynamic .cgi files
2.1. Format description

These files are analyzed and interpreted line by line. A line must not exceed 120 characters. 
Each line starts with a character describing how to to interpret it:

'#'	A hash mark tells the interpreter to ignore this line
't'	Text. The line will be sent to the browser without any changes
'i'	This line will be replaced by the file with the given name included,
'c'	This line will be interpreted, the output will be dynamically build. 
'.'	End of file.

Lines starting with the character 'c' will have some more characters following determining how to interpret them. The second character will be ignored, the third character will be used for the first and most important selection. Depending on this, the fifth character may be used as a secondary choice.

Dynamic files are examined and the returned content is generated at runtime. If you don't want to build your own .cgi-file, there's a dummy file "command.cgi" included in the Gemini firmware image, that allows to work with the parameters given below.

2.3 Serial Port Emulator

This emulator bridges the gap between the HTTP-based web interface and the serial commands. Commands sent as string value of the SE= parameter are executed by the serial command interpreter. It is possible to send several serial commands at once, but it must be assured that the responses not exceed 64 bytes, the length of a special output buffer used for the interpreter. This output can be obtained with the cgi command line "c C S %s".



2.4 Forms input
2.4.1 POST parameter

So far, the HTTP POST method is only used for file uploading and SD card formating.

2.4.2 GET parameter

Syntax:

Several command strings don't need any parameter values given (nothing noted after the equal sign) or simply ignore them, but most commands need them formed exactly as described below in C-printf syntax:

%d	integer
%u	unsigned integer
%f	floating point number
%s	string

All other characters have to appear exactly as they are shown.

3. Character encoding

Gemini-II supports internationalized messages. Special characters have to be displayed by the HC, browsers as well as they have to be exchanged between browser. 

XML-like character encoding is the only form of encoding that is fully supported by most browsers not only for displaying HTML pages, but also for Ajax technologies, which requires valid XML. For this reason, special characters should be coded in UCS Universal Character Set as defined by ISO/IEC 10646. Characters are encoded as numeric entities using the format 
	&#nnnn;
where nnnn is the numeric representation of the character (leading zeros my be omitted).

The graphical HC supports XML encoded Greek lowercase characters with nnnn reaching from 945 to 969:

945:	alpha	(coded: &#945;)
946:	beta	&#946;
947:	gamma	&#947;
948:	delta	&#948;
949:	epsilon	&#949;
... until ...
969:	omega	&#969;

The HC also supports the most common German, French and Spanish special characters. So far that are:

196:	Ä
205:	Í
214:	Ö
218:	Ú
220:	Ü
224:	à
225:	á
228:	ä
231:	c cedilla
232:	è
233:	é
234:	ê
237:	í
241:	~n (n with tilde above)
243:	ó
246:	ö
250:	ú
252:	ü

Other characters used may show up correctly in browsers but the HC will display a question mark '?'at its place.
