			I suggest that you fill in the default IP address with 19.1.68.0.100&nbsp; 
			Note it cannot be any address that you presently use on your

			the hand controller.&nbsp; Every device on a network has to have 
			it's own unique address.<br /><br /></li>
			<li>
			
			Fill the subnet mask in with 255.255.255.0<br /><br /></li>
			<li>
			
			Now fill the default gateway in with 192.168.0.1&nbsp; Note this 
			should be the base address of your network.&nbsp; If you base 
			address is 192.168.0.1 then that is what you will use. If you network 
			uses something like 192.168.1.1 then use that.&nbsp; Also change the 
			IP address to match such as 192.168.1.100.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			
			<br /><br /></li>
			<li>
			
			The Gemini-2 Default gateway address is going to have to match the 
			one in step 13.&nbsp; The Gemini-2 IP address will also have to be 
			in the same network.&nbsp; If the gateway is 192.168.1.1 then make 
			the Gemini-2 IP address 192.168.1.111 for instant.<br /><br /></li>
			<li>
			You are going to want to make sure Netbios is working on your network.&nbsp; <br /><br /></li>
			<li>
			Click the Advanced Box (see fig 7 above.) The below menu should come 
			up.<br /><br />
						<div align="center">

				<img alt=""  src="gemini-images/NetworkConfiguration/WIN10/IPSetting.jpg" height="610" width="500" /><br />

				<img alt=""  src="gemini-images/NetworkConfiguration/WIN10/advancedsetting.jpg" /><br />

				<br /><br />
				
				</li>
				<li>
				Now you have two choices here.&nbsp; If the Default box is 
				checked, and <a href="http://gemini/">http://gemini/</a> will 
				not bring up the Web Interface. Then Click the "Enable NetBios 
				over TCP/IP" check box.&nbsp; It the link works then leave the 
				setting at default.&nbsp; Hit the OK button and close out of 
				each window in turn.<br /><br />This ends the Windows 10 configuration.</li>

<p>(<b>Note:</b> As an alternate option, you can also use Windows key+X from the Start Menu (Tiles) to open the "classic" menu and choose Control Panel, then choose Network and Sharing Center).</p>

<ol>
	<li>From the View Your Active Networks section, select <b>Local Area Connection</b>.</li>
	<li>Go to Properties.<br/>
<em>Result:</em> The Local Area Connection Properties screen appears.</li>
	<li>Highlight <b>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</b> and click on <b>Properties</b>.<br/>
<em>Result</em>: The Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) Properties screen appears.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Use the following IP address</b>.</li>
	<li>Complete the configuration fields as shown below. This part of the configuration requires attention to detail, because one error will prevent you from getting on the network. Be sure you have this information at hand when you start to configure the TCP/IP protocol:
	<ul>
		<li>IP Address: 18.x.y.z (where x,y, and z are numbers)</li>
		<li>Subnet mask: 255.255.0.0</li>
		<li>Default gateway: 18.x.0.1 (Where x matches the x in your IP address)</li>
		<li>DNS (Domain Name Servers): 18.71.0.151, 18.70.0.160, 18.72.0.3</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Enter these numbers in the appropriate fields and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
	<li>Continue to click <b>OK</b> or <b>Close</b> as appropriate until you return to the Network Connections screen. The Local Area Connection icon text should now say "Enabled".</li>
	<li>Test your TCP/IP Settings: Launch your web browser. If you have completed the configuration successfully, the browser opens at your designated home page. If you have not completed the configuration, you will receive an error message that says that your browser was unable to connect properly. Go back and check your settings.</li>
