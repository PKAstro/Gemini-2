                    <li>New parking levels 0,1, 2.<br />While the mount resumed tracking in the former (now level 0) parking mode at every button touch, there are two additional parking levels.<br />Level 1 allows that GOTO commands are executed and resume
                        tracking.
                        <br />Level 2 insist on an Unpark command. This function is available at the HC, the GoTo button changes to Unpark as long as the mount is parked. It is also available at the Park screen, and in the ASCOM Gemini.net driver (1.0.51.0
                        and later).</li>
                    <li>Serial status command &lt;97 was extended (it returns 8 instead of 6 characters now, there's no change in the ENQ macro).</li>
                    <li>Serial command 92 was added for managing the parking level. There's no selection for parking levels on the HC yet, it must be done using the serial command over a communication path, ASCOM or the Functions web page.</li>
                    <li>Ruggedized TCP socket support.&nbsp;<br />The transparent socket access, using the serial commands, over the default TCP port 4030 has been extended in several ways. First, Keil reacted to the error reports René sent while trying to
                        connect to Southern Stars' Sky Safari. In fact, SkySafari is programmed in a really cruel way that René now uses to shock his students: For each command (like :GR# or :GD#) a TCP socket is opened, then these few bytes are put into
                        the output buffer and the socket is closed. Keil was not prepared for this behavior (although it complies to RF793), but now they are.<br />It's evident (and you can watch the socket port numbers climb up quickly on the Network
                        Statistics web page) that opening and closing several sockets a second doesn't improve SkySafari's performance, but this is the problem of Southern Stars. The iPhone 4 Rene tested with reacts pretty lame.</li>
                    <li>There are good news about using
                        <a href="http://www.stellarium.org/" target="_blank">Stellarium</a>. This is a really nice free planetarium program that works on Linux, Mac and Windows. For Windows, there is a
                        <a href="http://www.welshdragoncomputing.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=39" target="_blank">StellariumScope</a> software available that connects over ASCOM. In René's tests
                        it worked flawlessly over ASCOM and Ethernet. René started to work on a Linux driver, once available it should be possible to port it to MacOS.</li>
                    <li>Since the transparent sockets are not password protected, René has added some features to switch them off (by setting the TCP port to zero) and to specify a peer IP address to reject all other hosts. In the future this will be possibly
                        to specify a range of IP addresses (similar to a firewall rule).</li>
                    <li>Protection for UDP: The same security measures (switching off by setting the port to zero and selecting a peer IP) apply here. <br />The settings (both UDP and TCP) can be done over the Network web page. </li>
                    <li>Sebastian Mrozek contributed professionally designed buttons for the HC. They replace the built-in buttons. <span class="smalltext">(Aug 22, 2013)</span></li>
