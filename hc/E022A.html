		<u>None/Terrestrial Speed:</u> This rate turns tracking off completely and allows you to observe stationary objects such
			as points on land, or geosynchronous satellites.  It is also useful for keeping the telescope
			from exceeding its safety limits when the Gemini must be left on for extended periods of
			time between observations.
		<br /><br /></li>
		<li>
		<u>Lunar and Solar Tracking Speed:</u> Neither the lunar nor solar 
		tracking rates is constant. Since the orbits of Earth and Moon are 
		slightly elliptical, the apparent speed of Moon and Sun will change. 
		When you select the lunar or solar tracking rates, the tracking speed 
		will be calculated based on the actual position and the position one 
		hour later. Because the Moon orbits the Earth, its RA and Dec. change 
		during the course of the night. The lunar tracking rate compensates for 
		the RA component of that change; there is no compensation for the 
		changes in Dec. While sidereal rate can certainly be used for visual 
		lunar observing, the lunar rate will do a better job keeping the Moon 
		centered in the telescope’s field of view. Since the Moon is relatively near the Earth, even the location on Earth where you are observing must be taken into account. The lunar tracking rate therefore takes the parallax into account by calculating topocentric instead of geocentric positions.</li>

		Gemini computes the tracking rates by calculating the current position 
		of the Sun or Moon and the position one hour later. While the tracking rate for the 
		(distant) Sun will not change much during an observing session, the tracking rate for the 
		Moon might vary	significantly as its parallax changes moving from the horizon to higher 
		elevations and vice-versa. You can reselect the lunar tracking rate periodically 
		throughout the observing session to allow Gemini to recalculate the correct rate as needed.
		Because the Earth is orbiting the Sun, the Sun’s RA and Dec. do change 
		during the 	course of the day, but much more slowly than the Moon's. The solar 
		tracking rate again	compensates for the RA component of that change, but not for the Dec. 
		Since the difference between solar and sidereal rate is only about 4 minutes a 
		day, you will see little difference between the two over a short period of time.
