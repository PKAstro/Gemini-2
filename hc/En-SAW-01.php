		<br />
		It will automatically pick a star that should be above the horizon and 
		on the east side.&nbsp;(it probably will not be the same star shown in 
		the menu on the left.) If you do not want the star it picks simply hit 
		the East button and it will pick another.&nbsp;&nbsp; I keep hitting the 
		West button until I was sure that I had picked a star that would cause a 
		Meridian Flip.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;<br />
		<span class="auto-style1">Also stars on the west side that are close to 
		the meridian can be added to the East model.&nbsp; If the mount does not 
		pass 90 degrees Dec (IE do a meridian flip, then you are still building 
		a model on the east.&nbsp; The same holds true when going from a model 
		being built on the west to the east. This is actually designed this way 
		to help refine each model as you move from east to west or west to east.<br />
		</span>
		<br />
		If you are happy with the star it selects, then hit "GOTO".&nbsp; This 
		tutorial does not let you select different stars - so Please hit GOTO.</td>
