		You have 4 choices for startup. 
	<br />
		<br />
		<strong><em>Quick Start</em></strong> - This selection will take you to 
		menu's to select your "Mount Type", Enter your "Location", then "Time, 
		Time Zone and Date" Then you will go to the "Main Screen" This also does 
		a "Cold Start".<br />
		<br />
		<strong><em>Cold Start</em></strong> - A cold start wipes out all stored 
		modeling. You need to have your mount positioned at want is called CWD.&nbsp; 
		This is with the counter weights down, and the Declination pointed 
		towards Polaris in the Northern Hemisphere, and the South Celestial Pole in the Southern Hemisphere.<br />
		<br />
		<em><strong>Warm Start </strong></em>- This is basically the same as a cold start, but does not 
		wipe out any models build. It also remembers all your setting. You still 
		must start with the mount pointed to CWD position as in a cold start. If 
		you have models build, but have moved your Right Ascension axis or 
		Declination axis, but not the location of the mount itself, then you can 
		use this startup mode.<br />
		<br />
		<strong><em>Warm Restart</em></strong> - This mode also remembers your 
		modeling and all setting. You can only use this mode if, and only if you 
		have not moved both the Right Ascension axis or Declination axis and 
		also have not moved the mount in position.
