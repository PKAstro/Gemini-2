		<td class="style6">This 2 menus identifies up to ten celestial objects that lie within a 
		range of about 10 degrees from where the telescope is currently 
		pointing.<br />
		<br />
		The menu on the right will not normally come up, until you have 
		identified a catalog from the left menu.<br />
		<br />
		The left menu lets you select the catalog from which the stars will be 
		identified from, and the right menu will let you go between objects 
		that have been identified.<br />
		<br />
		Those objects nearest the central axis are listed first, and 
		the selection is refined as you designate the objectâ€™s catalog, type, and maximum magnitude (These latter items appear in the menu tree as 
		submenus of each other).<br />
		<br />
		You can scroll through the list of identified objects with the Up and 
		Down 
		buttons. As each object<br />
		is displayed, it becomes the "selected object," with coordinates and 
		data available in the<br />
		information buffer.&nbsp; The Object menu showing the objects is not 
		shown, as it varies too much.<br />
