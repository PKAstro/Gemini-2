		If you want to do a star 
		on the West, just hit the West button.&nbsp; <span class="style3">(Note: 
		if you hit the west button and the mount thinks it can reach it without 
		doing a meridian flip, it will try and go to it without the flip. You 
		really need to make sure that your limits are set. If they are not, then 
		the mount could hit and do damage to your telescope or mount.<br /> See 
		Menu--&gt;Mount--Limits) For some reason, my Gemini will not let me pick 
		a Western star, without taking the DEC through 90 degrees using the main 
		menu. See note below Picture.</span> <br />
		<span class="auto-style1">Also stars on the west side that are close to 
		the meridian can be added to the East model.&nbsp; If the mount does not 
		pass 90 degrees Dec (IE do a meridian flip, then you are still building 
		a model on the east.&nbsp; The same holds true when going from a model 
		being built on the west to the east. This is actually designed this way 
		to help refine each model as you move from east to west or west to east.<br />

		If you are happy with the star it selects, then hit "GOTO".&nbsp; This 
		tutorial does not let you select different stars - so Please hit GOTO.</td>
