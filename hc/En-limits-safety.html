		This is the Safety Limit setting screen.  It is 
		also described on the 
		<a href="En-limits.html" target="_self">/hc/En-limits.html</a>.<br />
		<br />
		Note: Safety Limits may not take effect until you power down and back up. 
		This has been my experience.&nbsp; The writer of the code says they take 
		effect when set.<br />
		<br />The limits can be set either using the Web interface, on the Mount 
		Selection Page, (it is under Menu--&gt;Mount--&gt;Limits) or on the menu 
		to the left.<br />
		<br />
		Note that the Web limits are set for left and right side, while the hand 
		controller uses East and West.&nbsp; If 
		using the hand controller, follow these steps. Also the safety limits are referenced to the CWD startup position.  If you did not start up with a Cold start, or Warm Start with the mount at CWD, you must do this before setting the limits.
It a very bad idea to start up with a "Warm Restart" and assume that the Gemini 2 has remembered the CWD.  You can tell the Gemini-2 to part at CWD to make sure it knows where CWD is.<br />

		The Western Goto Limit determines how far pass the meridian that the
		Gemini-2 will do a flip.&nbsp; It is calculated like this. Note
		that the Meridian is at 90 degrees.<br /> The point of Meridian Flip = Western
		Safety Limit - Western Goto Limit.<br />An example is if you have the Western
		Safety limit set to 100 degrees - The Western GoTo limit of 2.5 degrees
		(default) you end up with a point of flip of 97.5 degrees, or 7.5
		degrees past the meridian. Any target selected that is past this
		will do a meridian flip.&nbsp; Any target on the East side (Northern
		Hemisphere) will not do a meridian flip.</li>

		The rear RA tactical buttons are active so that you can move the mount

		limit and press "Set Limit Here"<br />

		Also the Limits are are stored permanently as "physical step" values
and they don't depend on the model. <strong>But</strong>: the Safety limits depend
on a <strong>good</strong> CWD position of the RA axis.

With a sync or model, the Index parameters are set instead. 

Nevertheless, with a Western limit of 95 degrees set and a 2.5 degrees GOTO limit,
there are only 2,5 degrees left.  Especially if pointing at the Zenith,
there will be an unreachable zone if the model has to take care of a rough polar alignment.
