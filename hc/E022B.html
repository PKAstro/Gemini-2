		<u>Adaptive King Tracking Speed:</u> In the absence of the Earth’s atmosphere, sidereal 
		rate tracking would be all that is
		needed to accurately track objects with fixed RA and Dec. coordinates 
		(any object
		outside the solar system). However, because the Earth’s atmosphere 
		refracts (bends)
		light, it complicates the situation. The light from an object close to 
		the horizon must pass
		through more atmosphere than an object higher in the sky. It is 
		therefore subject to more
		refraction, causing the object to appear to be slightly higher in the 
		sky than it actually is. 
		This is called refraction. As the object climbs higher in the sky, it is 
		subject to less and
		less refraction, and catches up with its refracted image. This means 
		that objects appear to
		move at a rate slightly slower than sidereal rate when they are close to 
		the horizon. 
		Several methods have been devised to compensate for this effect called 
		"differential
		refraction.”
		<br />
			<br />
			The King method (published 1931 by Edward Skinner King) helps to avoid star trailing in photographs caused by differential refraction. Differential refraction may especially affect wide field photographs with long exposures. </li>

		King proposed two measures: 
• Offsetting the polar axis slightly towards the zenith, and
• Adjusting the tracking rate. 
The values necessary to accomplish this depend on the geographical coordinates of the observing site and the declination of the object being photographed. Gemini's Adaptive King rate tracking varies the tracking speed to match the required value for the selected object’s declination. The user must offset the elevation of the polar axis himself.

		<u>Closed Loop Tracking Speed:</u> The preceding discussion of tracking rates assumes 
		that the mount is accurately polar aligned, allowing tracking to be 
		accomplished using only the RA motor. However, for visual observing 
		sessions, there is no need for extremely accurate polar alignment. By 
		selecting Closed Loop tracking, Gemini can accurately track an object 
		even if polar alignment is off several degrees in any direction. Gemini 
		does this by comparing the coordinates of the object being tracked with 
		the actual coordinates of the telescope. If the&nbsp; coordinates do not 
		match, Gemini makes slow corrections in both RA and Dec. axes to point 
		the telescope back at the object. This process of compare and correct is 
		done about 22 times per second. Although Closed Loop tracking will keep 
		an object centered for a long time, it is not a substitute for a good 
		polar alignment – especially if you intend to photograph extended 
		objects. A misaligned polar axis will lead to field rotation, an effect 
		where objects in the field of view will rotate around the center. 
		However, after having done a good polar alignment, Closed Loop tracking 
		can be used to photograph slow moving objects, such as minor planets or 
		comets. This can work even if the object moves at a varying speed, by 
		repeatedly sending actual coordinates to the Gemini using a computer. 
		Because Gemini uses modeling parameters to calculate coordinates, Closed 
		Loop tracking is only available after a pointing model has been 
		established.&nbsp;&nbsp;
