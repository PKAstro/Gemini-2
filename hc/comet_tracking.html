			The Comet tracking rate allows you to program Gemini to set independent RA and Dec.
tracking rates to follow comets and other solar system objects that follow unique
trajectories. There are several methods you can use to achieve this:<br />
 		   <ul>
			   <li>Training - Train the tracking by centering on the initial and the end position of an
object over an arbitrary interval of time.</li>
			   <li>Coordinate Controlled - Enter the RA/Dec. positions at the start and at the end
of an interval of time.</li>
			   <li>Timer Values – RA and Dec. timer divisors can be calculated and entered
directly.  
								</li>
			   <li>PC Controlled - Calculate the necessary tracking rates at a PC and download
them to the Gemini. </li></ul>

For each of these methods, a new tracking value for Gemini’s internal timer that controls
the tracking speed will be calculated and loaded.  The available timer range limits the
lowest possible speed.  Faster tracking (moving towards smaller RA values) does not
have this limitation.<br /><br />

Positive Dec. rates mean that the Dec. values are getting higher with time.  Upon
reaching the pole, the direction will not be changed.  After crossing the pole, Dec. will
decrease. <br /><br />

The Comet/User Defined tracking values are preserved as long as the Gemini is not
powered down.  The programmed rate can be activated again (after another tracking rate 
was used) with the “Setup→Mount Parameter→Tracking Speed→Comet
Tracking→Activate” menu item.  If the Gemini was powered down while in Comet/User 
Defined tracking mode, it will start up in Sidereal mode.<br /><br />
 
Training Comet Tracking<br /><br />
 
When you select “Setup→Mount Parameter→Tracking Speed→Comet Tracking→Train
Tracking,” a training phase is started.  Unlike training PEC, you don't have to follow the
motions exactly. Just keep the object in the eyepiece for a sufficient amount of time. 
Finally, center it and press the MENU button to end the training phase.  Gemini
calculates the necessary tracking rates in RA as well as in Dec. and the mount will follow
the object in both axes.<br /><br />

The amount of time needed for training will vary with the object and the type of
observation.  For an object with a relatively slow and constant motion, a few minutes of
training should be sufficient for visual observing.  For photography, you may want to
consider training for up to half of the intended exposure time.  For an object that changes
speed fairly quickly (such as a Near Earth Asteroid), shorter training sessions just before
the observation will work best.  In general however, for an object with relatively constant
speed, the longer the training (up to 45 minutes) and the more exactly the object is
centered at the beginning and end of training, the better the tracking will be.<br /><br />

After the training, “Show Information” displays the number of steps done and timer
values calculated.  If the training reveals an RA motion too slow to follow within the RA
timer’s range, an RA timer value of 65535 (the maximum value) will be displayed and
used instead.<br /><br />
 
Coordinate Controlled Tracking<br /><br />
 
Calculating the tracking rate using coordinates is useful if you want to track an object for
which you have an ephemeris.  Knowing 2 different positions of the object at different
times, Gemini can calculate the speed required to track the object.  You can use the 
“Setup→Mount Parameter→Tracking Speed→Comet Tracking→Calculate Rates” menu
item to enter coordinates from an ephemeris for the object you want to observe.  Gemini
asks for three pieces of data: two sets of object coordinates, and the amount of elapsed
time (in hours) between them.   The coordinate difference is used to calculate the
necessary tracking rates in both RA and Dec. Since only the difference is used, the
coordinates need not reflect the exact location of the object at the current time.  If the RA
value is outside the possible range, the input will be rejected.<br /><br />

If the coordinates change very slowly, you can multiply all values (RA, Dec. differences
and the time interval) by a constant to input them with increased accuracy.<br /><br />
 
Timer Values<br /><br />
 
Comet Tracking allows you to manually enter rates for both RA and Dec.  In both cases,
these are divisor values that are used to divide the timer frequency to calculate the rate at
which the motors are driven.<br /><br />
 
RA Rate<br /><br />

Gemini uses a 1.5 MHz timer to regulate the tracking rate in RA.  The number that you
enter as the RA rate divisor will be divided into 1,500,000 to determine the number of
steps per second made by the RA motor.  Increasing the RA timer value slows the
tracking down, while decreasing the timer value speeds up the tracking.  Note that for
some mounts, such as the GM-8, CI-700, and Titan, the 1.5 MHz clock is pre-scaled by a
factor of 2.<br /><br />

To determine the correct divisor for sidereal tracking for your mount, use the following
equation:<br />
			<br />
			RADivisor = ((1.500.000 /prescaler ) / StepsPerRev) / Worm Period<br />
			<br />where prescaler is a mount-dependant scaling value, StepsPerRev is the number of motor
steps per revolution of the worm, and WormPeriod is the period of the worm in seconds. 
The table below lists the values for prescaler, StepsPerRev, and WormPeriod for various
mounts:<br />
			<br />
			<table style="width: 900px">
				<tr>
					<td>MOUNT</td>
					<td>Prescaler</td>
					<td>StepsPerREV</td>
					<td>WormPeriod</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>G11, HGM-200, MI-250</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>6400</td>
					<td>239.344658 sec</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Losmandy Titan</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>6400</td>
					<td>319.1262611 sec</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>GM-8, CI-700</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>6400</td>
					<td>478.68939 sec</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Losmandy Titan 50:1</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>12800</td>
					<td>318.1262611 sec</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<br />
 
For example, to find the correct RA rate divisor for sidereal rate on a G-11, we get:
 
			<br />
			((1,500,000/1)/(6400/239.344656) = 56096<br /><br />
Dec Rate<br /><br />

The divisor for Dec. movement is calculated in a similar manner. For moving in Dec., an
internal timer of 22.8881835938 Hz frequency is used.  As with the RA divisor, the Dec.
divisor value is divided into the timer frequency to determine the number of steps per
second that the Dec. motor will make. A value of zero disables tracking in Dec., while a
value of 1 would select the maximum speed of approx 22.9 steps per second. Higher
values will slow Dec. movement down. The direction of the Dec. movement depends on
the sign specified and the side of the meridian the telescope points to. <br /><br />

PC Controlled Tracking <br /><br />

In addition to programming to track visible objects, serial line command capability has
been provided to allow the user to set his or her own RA/Dec. tracking rates.  This "User 
Defined Tracking" (to be used instead of a training phase) is useful for tracking minor
planets and comets by setting the necessary rates using a computer program.  For more
information on how computer software can produce these commands, Serial Line Protocol.<br /><br />

Comet tracking produces the same undesirable field rotation as Closed Loop tracking if
the mount is not adequately polar aligned.  With the tracking rate set correctly for a
moving object, that object will be imaged as a point, but other objects that are moving at
a different speed will be trailed on the image. <br /><br />
