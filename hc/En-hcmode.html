			This menu lets you select the speed that the buttons on the back (tactile) work in. 
		
			These buttons works in one of three modes: the Visual Mode, the Photo Mode and
			the All Speeds Mode. <br />
			<br />
			You can move both axes simultaneously in all 3 modes. You select 
			the mode by use of this menu. Like some other settings,
			it is remembered permanently and will be in effect even after powering off and on again.  
		<br />
		<br />
		<span class="auto-style1"><em><strong>The Visual Mode -</strong></em></span>  
			In visual mode, the Guiding Speed is not available. When you press a button, the
			telescope moves at Centering Speed.  Momentarily pushing the opposite button 
			(tactile buttons only) lets the
			system accelerate to the manual slewing speed.  If you are moving both axes, both will
			speed up.  Ramping up and down in speed occurs independently for both axes.  
			This mode is intended for visual observing and for looking up objects. The auto-guider
			port is not active in this mode.  <br />
			<em><strong><br />
			The Photo Mode -</strong></em> In Photo Mode, Guiding Speed is the 
			principal speed, so pressing a Hand Controller directional button 
			moves the telescope at the selected Guiding Speed; Slewing Speed is 
			not available. Acceleration to Centering Speed is available in four 
			stages (to allow easy centering of an object in the field of view or 
			on a CCD chip) by pressing the opposite tactile button while Gemini 
			is guiding: Pressing the opposite button once changes to 1/8 of 
			Centering Speed to allow fine centering of the target.&nbsp;

		Then, after about 2 seconds, the speed will increase to ¼ Centering 
		Speed, after another 2 seconds to ½ Centering Speed, and finally to full 
		Centering Speed.&nbsp;
		Pressing the opposite button twice changes to full Centering Speed immediately.  
			If you want to guide a photograph manually, you may plug a Standard (not Deluxe) Hand
			Controller into Gemini’s auto-guider port. This way you are sure that you cannot
			accidentally move the scope at centering speed while guiding.  The LED on the standard
			Hand Controller will not be illuminated when plugged into the 
		auto-guider port.  
			<br />
			<br />
			<span class="auto-style1"><em><strong>The All Speeds Mode</strong></em></span>  
			In this mode, all speeds are available, from Guiding Speed to Slewing Speed, by using
			the opposite-button trick. You can use this mode, for example, while drift aligning, when
			you need very fine centering of a star at the crosshairs and a fast move from the meridian
			to the eastern or western horizon. However, for normal observing, you'll probably select
			either the Visual or Photo Mode.</td>
