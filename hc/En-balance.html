				This menu will not function if the Servo processors, (separate 
				from the ARM processor) have not been programmed with the 
				firmware that was released around Sept 2012. This 
				firmware requires a separate hardware PIC programmer and special 
				cables to install. It is not part of any firmware downloads for either the 
				main unit or hand controller. It is only available by 
				special request. All newer Gemini-2 units are shipped with 
				this firmware already installed. If your balance menu functions, 
				then you have it. If you are interested here are instruction on
		<a href="../servo_programmer.html" target="_self">updating the firmware</a>.</span></td>

		This menu shows the Servo Duty cycles for both the RA and DEC motors.
		<br /><br />Y:&nbsp; PWM 
		is DEC. Any torque on the Dec motor will 
		result in the lines lengthening. These lines indicate more power is 
		being sent to the motor, to try and correct the positional error. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation" target="_blank">PWM</a> 
		stands for Pulse width modulation. 0% would be no pulses and 100% would 
		be full power&nbsp;&nbsp; The higher the number the wider the power 
		pulse feed to the motor.&nbsp; The offset is how much the motor shaft is 
		from the desired position due to axis imbalance.
		<br /><br />X: PWM is the RA axis. Any torque on the RA motor will 
		result in the lines lengthening. These lines indicate more power is 
		being sent to the motor, to try and correct the positional error. PWM 
		stands for Pulse width modulation. 0% would be no pulses and 100% would

		The Back button takes you all the way back to<br />
		the Main Menu.<br />
		<br />
		The rear tactile buttons are active so that you can move the mount 
		while in this screen. They were made active with the Sept 20, 2013 
		hand controller firmware update.<br />
		<br />
		The firmware to make this option possible was first 
		introduced in Sept of 2012. Sometime later, 
		Losmandy started including this firmware in shipped models. Please see text to the left.<br />
