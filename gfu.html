                    write code for the MAC or other computers, so please don't ask him too. Also Paul is like me, he is not associated with Losmandy in any way, and is freely donating his time and knowledge to help fellow Gemini users.&nbsp; We should
                    all thank Paul for doing this. Also Paul only wanted to spend a minimum amount of time developing this utility.&nbsp; He has already expended much more time that he ever expected to in it's development and testing.&nbsp; So please
                    no asking for changes to the utility.&nbsp; If you want changes, the source code is provided at:&nbsp;
                    <a href="https://github.com/pkastro/gfu" target="_blank">
		https://github.com/pkastro/gfu</a><br /> If you have any error situations, Please capture any screen error messages and forward them to the
                    <a href="https://groups.io/g/Gemini-II">Gemini-II 
		Users Group</a>. Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 does have the snipping tool.&nbsp; Just put Snipping Tool in the Search box.&nbsp; It should be the top entry.&nbsp; Use it to capture a jpg of the error please.<br />
                    <br /><br/>If you are having problems updating firmware using GFU, you can always try the
                    <a href="rebuildmainSDcardfirmware.html" target="_self">manual method to 
		rebuild the micro-SDcard.<br />
		<br />
		P</a>lease read all the instructions before starting.<br /><br /> This program will: <br /> <br />1. Download the latest
                    <a href="javascript:localURL('firmware1/combined.zip')" target="_blank">https://gemini-2.com/firmware1/combined.zip</a> from Losmandy website.<br /> 2. Extract all the files from the archive to a temporary directory. %appdata%\Roaming\GFU
                    for Win7<br /> 3. Uses FTP to send all the files to Gemini (you can choose to send only the main SD card files, Hand Controller Files, Video, hand controller catalogs or all the firmware that is supplied in the combined.zip file.)<br
                    /> 4. Store all setting before flashing the new firmware and then restores them after the flashing is completed.<br /> 5. Optionally flashes the uploaded firmware, resets SRAM and reboots Gemini
                    <br /> 6. Optionally updates the catalog files in the hand controller. (Click Catalogs to do this.)<br /> 7. Optionally updates the Video Files Scott Losmandy has provided.&nbsp; Please note that if you select this option, the upload
                    portion will slow down at about 94%.&nbsp; This is where it starts uploading the video files and they are large compared to the other files.&nbsp; Just be patient, and don't worry, this is normal.<br /> &nbsp; <br /> You can also select
                    other files to update the Gemini-2 with besides the default combined.zip file.<br />
                    <br /> YOU must normally be connected to the Internet, and the Gemini-II via Ethernet with the same computer, with the Gemini-II turned on, for this program to work.&nbsp;
                    <br /> You will also need to know the IP address that your Gemini-2 is using to connect to the Computer. You can find this on the Web interface on the "Network" tab or on the hand controller by going to: Menu--&gt;Mount--&gt;Network,
                    or Menu--&gt;System--&gt;Network.<br />
                    <br /> You can keep the hand controller plugged in if you wish.&nbsp; The motors can be disconnected with no damage to the Gemini-2. To keep the Gemini-2 from complaining, if you remove the motors you might want to make the tracking
                    speed
                    <a href="http://gemini/functions.cgi?ts=4&amp;set=Set+Tracking+Rate" target="_blank">
		Terrestrial</a> speed using the Functions tab of the Web interface or "MENU"--&gt;"Track"--&gt;"Terrestrial" on the hand controller.&nbsp; Don't forget to put it back to
                    <a href="http://gemini/functions.cgi?ts=0&amp;set=Set+Tracking+Rate" target="_blank">
		Sidereal</a> Tracking after the update.<br />
                    <br /> Also if you have multiple Gemini-2 units, please make sure only one is turned on and you are using the IP address of that unit with the utility.
                    <br />
                    <br /> You also need

		Net Framework 4.51</a> if it is not already installed on your computer.&nbsp; I noticed that not all the features of Net Framework 4.51 was not enabled on Windows 10, you should enable them by thes instructions: a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>”
                    + “<strong><em>R</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard.<br /> b) Type “<strong><em>appwiz.cpl</em></strong>” in the “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>” command box and press “<strong><em>ENTER</em></strong>”. <br /> c) In the “<strong><em>Programs and Features</em></strong>”
                    window, click on the link “<strong><em>Turn Windows features on or 
			off</em></strong>”.<br /> d) Check if the “<strong><em>.NET Framework 4.5 (includes 
			.NET 2.0 and 3.0)</em></strong>” option is available in it.<br /> e) If yes, then enable it and then click on “<strong><em>OK</em></strong>”<br /> f) follow the rest of the instructions. <br />

                            of the HCFirmware directory will be uploaded to the hand controller by the main unit and hand controller. Note: when this has finished, the hand controller will reboot. Also this empties the HCFirmware directory of the micro-SDcard

                                    flashed, and then all the hand controller files have been uploaded to the hand controller and it has flashed itself and rebooted, the rerun the GFU program and only check the catalog box and no other. After a power
                                    cycle, the catalogs will be uploaded to the hand controller. If you are sure you have the newer hand controller, then it should be ok to select both the HC check box and the Catalogs check box.</li>

                    again. There is no need to close the Gemini Firmware updat program. After the catalogs are uploaded, (The upload box turns Green), Turn off your Gemini 2 and then turn it back on. All the files for the hand controller will then start
                    to be uploaded to the hand controller. When this upload is done, then the catalogs will be uploaded to the hand controller. Congratulations.

                    to REDO the GFU program, but only CHECK "Gemini" and "Flash Firmware" at the top of the selection page. (Assuming that the first time through GFU, the hand controller was updated and has a March 12 2017 date.) At the bottom of the
                    GFU selection page select "Format SD Card" Once in a while a file is left on the micro-SDcard that will not let the GFU program flash the firmware into the main processor. Formatting the micro SDcard gets rid of it. It will also delete
                    the store configure file that you may have created.&nbsp; Once the micro SDcard is FORMATED, the start over and do GFU again with only "Gemini" and "Flash Firmware" checked.<br />
