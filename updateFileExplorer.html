				<br />This general guide will help you update the firmware in your Gemini 2&nbsp; 
				main unit and hand controller using Windows File Explorer.
				
				This instructions uses 
				the windows file explorer to do the upgrade. I am going to suggest that you add the Gemini-2
				as a network place in your computer.  Then you can copy that network place and place it as a shortcut
				on your desktop.  Here is a 
				<a href="network-places.html" target="_blank">link</a> on how to do that, &nbsp;&nbsp; 
				After you do that, come back here and complete this instructions 
				to complete the upgrade. You will also need to 
				know how to unzip a zip file.&nbsp; Most Windows Operating 
				Systems let you do this by right mouse clicking on a file and 
				selecting un-pack or unzip.&nbsp; I like the utility
				<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7ZIP</a> and 
				highly recommend it for Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also 
				alternate instructions provided to creating an FTP link on your 
				desktop. See&nbsp; the paragraph below step 5, for the alternate 
				instructions.

		If you do not have the motors connected, then the Gemini will 
			emit a beep about every 15 seconds telling you a motor is 
			stalled. This will not hurt anything.	Â  The Gemini 2 is fine without the motors connected.&nbsp; 
				You can use the hand controller and put the tracking mode into 
				terrestrial mode, using "menu--&gt;Track--&gt;Terrestrial".<br />
					<br />We are going to perform the following steps:<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Disconnect the hand controller.</li>
					<li>Download the firmware to a location on your hard drive 
					and unzip it.</li>
					<li>Upload the firmware to the Gemini, using Windows File 
					Explorer window in FTP mode.</li>
					<li>Go into the Web interface and flash the firmware (this programs the 
					main firmware).</li>
					<li>Reset the SRam.</li>
					<li>Cold boot the Gemini.</li>
					<li>Reconnect the Hand controller (this programs the hand 
					controller.)

					Now for the detailed instructions:<br />
					<br />
			I also created a <a href="Explorer_version/gemini-firmware-upgrade3.html" target="_self">
			Flash Version movie that use Windows Explorer</a> as an FTP client.
			<br /><br />1.&nbsp; We need to disconnect the hand controller. If you don't like 
				connecting and disconnecting the hand controller with power on, 
				you can power off the Gemini-2, disconnect the Hand controller, 
				and then Power ON the Gemini.&nbsp; However it really does not 
				hurt to just disconnect the hand controller, so please use 
				either method to disconnect the hand controller now.&nbsp; If 
					you powered down to disconnect the hand controller please 
					make sure you can still connect to the Gemini 2 (See above)<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Download the specially created file
					<a href="javascript:localURL('firmware1/current/combined.zip')" target="_blank">combined.zip</a> 
					to a empty directory on your hard drive.&nbsp; This zip file 
			contains all the files to update both the Main Gemini Unit and hand 
			controller. &nbsp;<br />
