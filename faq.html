			<br />Answer: WARNING: The Gemini-1 has several Startup modes. If is your habit of 
		leaving the Gemini-1 powered on and parked, when not in use, then you 
		should always make sure that you use one of the two options below. This 
		is because if you have a power failure, and then power is restored, and 
		the mount is in Cold Start, Warm Start, or Warm Restart, then the RA 
		motor will start running at the tracking rate set, and can possibility run your telescope into 
		your roof, or a limit, without you knowing it until too late:<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Set your startup mode to&nbsp; "ASK IF POSSIBLE."&nbsp; or<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Put the telescope into 
		terrestrial mode tracking after parking.&nbsp;  Just remember to switch it back to Sidereal mode when starting 
		up again.&nbsp; This is the safest option.

		<td class="style6">
			Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gemini unit has to have either the hand controller or an 
			external computer to tell it which mode to boot in. When the Gemini initializes, 
			it looks to see if a hand controller is connected, or some other type of 
			communications adapter is connected to the DB15 pin connector.&nbsp; If it 
			detects a hand controller, then it will go ahead and send out the display 
			commands to the hand controller.&nbsp; If a hand controller is not present, or a 
			Second Serial Port adapter is present, then the Gemini will stop and wait for a 
			signal into either the normal RS-232 port or the Second Serial Port, to tell it 
			that a computer or PDA or some kind of controlling device is present.&nbsp; The

			<a name="Q3"></a>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a ground loop and how can you test for one?
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="style6">
		Answer: A ground loop is a difference of potential in voltage between connected devices.  It is normal to have a small difference due to the resistance in cables and connectors. However it should not be more than 1 volt in practice.  Here is a good article that explains ground loops: 
		<a href="downloads/pdf/ground-loops.pdf" target="_blank" title="Ground Loops ">Ground Loops Article</a>
		<span class="style3">Answer for how do you test for one.</span><br />
		<Span class="style6">Ground loops and power supplies are tricky thing.
		Take these steps to find out if you have a possible ground loop.
		<br />
		1. Turn off all power supplies. Leave the power supplies plugged into the
		house current.
		<br />
		2. Disconnect all power supplies from the Gemini and camera. Leave the
		one to the computer plugged in.
		<br />
		3. Measure with an ohm meter between the Gemini power pins of the VCD
		OUT GND pin (see page 131 of L4 manual) on the Gemini to the Ground pin
		of the Camera and then a ground spot on the Computer. Also measure
		between the camera and computer. A reading of NO ohms would be perfect.
		Any low reading could mean you might have a ground loop. This means that
		the power supply input is not isolated from the power supply output.
		<br />
		4. Next turn all power supplies on. Measure for voltage between the
		ground outputs to each other.
		A zero reading is good. anything above 1 volt is bad. Voltage between
		0 and 1 volt can also be bad, but depends on how large you wires are.
		Remember that you are doing this with no/very little current flowing.
		<br />
		5. Reconnect the camera, Gemini and computer. do step 4 with them
		connected. and see what you have.
		They should not have changed much. Again voltage between the units is a
		bad thing.
		<br />
		<br />
		
		Computers can cause ground loops because they normally get connected to
		many other powered devices like monitors, networks and printers through
		wires.
		<br />
		<br />
	
		The best way to eliminate ground loops is to have all the neutral
		(ground) DC output of every device tied to a central point,
		through a heavy (12 Gauge) wire. The central point when using a Gemini
		would be the Gemini ground input pins. This is not easy to always do.
		The next best is opto or magnetic isolated inputs to the Guider and
		RS232 inputs.
		<br />
		<br />

		If you do do a central ground between your devices, consider putting in a
		ground rod at least 8 ft deep next to the central point into the
		ground. This can help prevent static damage.<br /><br />

		The best preventive is to use Isolated RS232 or USB adapters and Guiders into the Gemini. 
		They can eliminate ground loops.  I use one on all inputs to my Gemini. Of 
		course I manufactured my own.<br />
		<br />

		One word on note: The Gemini's with the slide switch for power do not have the electronics grounded to the case. The Gemini's with the Toggle switch do have the electronics grounded to the case.

			Answer:&nbsp; If using the ASCOM driver for your mount? Go into the driver setup and click first on the &quot;Modeling Parameters&quot;
			button. This should show all zeros. If it does not, click on &quot;Clear Parameters&quot;
			and store the clear out in your Gemini. Now go back to the main setup window and
			click on &quot;Advanced Setup&quot;. In the top right of the window that opens you should
			see a check box with &quot;Sync Mode Affects Model (Additional Align)&quot;. Make sure<br />
			this is UN-checked. Otherwise every time you do a sync you will be adding to a
			Gemini model which would adversely interact with the TPoint model. While you are
			in there, uncheck precession and refraction calculations, as TheSky does this

		</td>		
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="style6">
			Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. You can use as many as you have USB ports.  Please note that each 
			one will be assigned a Serial port number according to which one is plugged into which 
			port.  Each USB to Serial Adapter has a unique serial number.  So lets say that your 
			first RS-232 adapter has serial number 2001 and your second has serial number 4001.  
			Lets also say that you have 3 USB ports on your laptop called 1, 2 and 3.
			Now lets say that you plug RS-232 #2001 adapter into  USB port 1.  The computer might 
			assign it Com port 3,
			<br />
			Now lets say that you unplug adapter #2001 and plug in adapter 4001 into USB port 1, 
			The computer might assign it to Com 4.
			<br />
			Now lets say that you plug adapter #2001 into USB port #2.  The computer might assign 
			it to Com 5.
			<br />
			As you can see, XP uses the adapters serial number and which USB port to assign the serial ports.
			<br />
			My recommendation is mark each adapter to which USB port you are plugging it into, and 
			always use the same setup.  That way you will continue to use the same predictable COM 
			port setting.

			<a name="Q8"></a>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the different between the old and new 
			auto-guider ports?
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="style6">
			Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly from the manual:
			<br />
			4.2.1 The Autoguider Port.<br />
			IMPORTANT: There are two different versions of the Gemini Autoguider 
			port hardware. The versions can be distinguished by the type of 
			connectors used for the motor cables. The older Gemini version uses 
			RJ-45 modular connectors, and the newer version uses 6-pin DIN 
			connectors. The primary difference between the versions is that the 
			older Gemini Users Manual&nbsp; version 4.1 paragraph 4.2.1 says the 
			guider port does not directly support autoguiders with TTL output, 
			but the newer version does.
			Gemini contains a separate Autoguider port  a 6-pin modular RJ-11 socket located
			below the 15-pin connector to the left. It contains a common pin, four directional pins
			and one pin that is controlled by the alarm signal that can be used for shutter control. The
			common pin of the RJ-11 modular connector is connected to +5V on the older version of
			Gemini, and GND on the newer version. The 4 directional inputs must be connected to
			the common pin to be active (they are active at High potentials on the older version of
			Gemini, and at Low potentials on the newer version). Simultaneously activating opposing
			directional signals (DEC+ and DEC- or RA+ and RA-) will be ignored and displayed as
			Autoguider Error.<br />
			
			<b>Note: </b>The autoguider port is only active in the Photographic Mode and All-
			Speeds Mode of the Gemini system. Selecting the Visual Mode disables Guiding
			and therefore the Autoguider Port.
			<br />
			More from the manual: <br />
			<br />
			
			<b>4.2.2 Manual Guiding</b><br />
			Manual guiding is usually done using an eyepiece with an illuminated reticle attached to
			an off-axis guider or separate guidescope. You center a star (or the object being
			photographed) in the reticle and use the buttons on the Deluxe Hand Controller to apply
			guiding corrections to keep the star on the reticle throughout the duration of the exposure.
			Rather than using the Deluxe Hand Controller, you can instead guide with a Losmandy
			Standard Hand Controller plugged into the autoguider port. The LED of the Standard
			Hand Controller will not normally be lit, but will light up anytime the alarm sounds.
			Using a Standard Hand Controller in the autoguider port has a big advantage for manual
			guiding, in that accidentally pressing opposite directional buttons simultaneously will not
			result in movement at centering speed, as happens with the Hand Controller in its normal
			socket, or when using the Deluxe Hand Controller. This reduces the risk of spoiling a
			long exposure photograph due to an accidental key press.
			In either case, you will need to make sure that the Hand Controller is set to either the Photographic or All-Speeds Mode.<br />
			<br />
			<b>4.2.3 Connecting an Autoguider to an Older Gemini:<br />
			4.2.3.1 Connecting an Autoguider with Relay Output<br />
			</b> 
			Autoguiders with relay outputs (such as the SBIG ST-4) can be connected to the Gemini
			system directly. Simply connect one side of each of the four relay contacts to the
			Autoguider input common pin, and connect the other side of each relay to the appropriate
			direction input pins of the autoguider port. Cables are available for most compatible
			autoguiders to plug directly between the autoguider and Gemini.
			Gemini Users Manual <br /><b>42
			4.2.3.2 Connecting an Autoguider with TTL Output:<br /></b>
			The typical "open collector" output stage (e.g. the ST-7/8/9/10, user-modified ST-4) has
			high impedance while inactive and pulls down the direction signals to a common ground
			when active. This is exactly the opposite of the way the Hand Controller and autoguider
			ports of the older version Gemini system work.
			A relay (or optocoupler) decouples the switching device (the Autoguider) from the
			controlled device (the Gemini), thereby avoiding a direct connection between the two
			systems and protecting both systems against high currents that could cause damage.

			<br /><b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:<br /></b>
			(1) Never connect TTL output stages directly to the Hand Controller or autoguider ports
			of an older version Gemini! Severe damage may occur to the connected devices. Use a
			Relay Box (as provided by SBIG) or the optional Losmandy Optocoupler unit instead.
			By so doing, you get the additional advantage of providing electrical protection to these
			sensitive units.
			(2) The use of two separate power supplies without a coupler unit is strongly
			discouraged. To do so would connect the ground of one system to the supply voltage of
			the other system, causing the two grounds to be at different potentials. If the grounds of
			the two systems are then connected, severe damage is likely to occur.
			Detailed instructions for connecting an SBIG camera with TTL outputs to the older
			version of Gemini can be found in Appendix 8.6 (Autoguider Port).
			4.2.4 Connecting an Autoguider to a Newer Gemini
			The Autoguider port on the newer versions of Gemini is plug compatible with a large
			variety of autoguiders. You can use an autoguider with relay outputs such as the SBIG
			ST-4 and STV or an autoguider with TTL outputs such as the SBIG ST-7/8/9/10 directly
			using the appropriate cable. Use SBIGs TIC cable for the ST-4 and STV, and SBIGs
			TIC-78 cable for cameras with TTL output.
			The SBIG relay box can be used, but is not necessary. The Losmandy Optocoupler is not
			compatible with the newer Gemini. <br />

			Also Note that the Common pin is not ground on the Newer style Gemini's. It is pulled to ground through a 100 ohm resistor.
			All the guider inputs are pulled to +5V through 3.3K ohm pullups.
			<br />
			<br />
			I highly recommend the USB Guide Port interface for OLD Gemini 
			called GPUSB-AH from
			<a href="http://www.store.shoestringastronomy.com/products_gp.htm" target="_blank">
			http://www.store.shoestringastronomy.com/products_gp.htm</a>&nbsp; if you 
			have the older version of the Gemini-1 boards, which have RJ-12 
			jacks for motor connectors.&nbsp; You will also need the correct 
			guide cable to go with it.&nbsp; The one supplied by S-Big if you 
			have a SBig camera will not work.<br />

	<li>Under the View menu, select show hidden devices. </li>
	<li>Under Ports you should see all the devices that Windows has allocated now. You can modify them and delete them if you need, but please be careful what 	you delete.</li>
	</ol>

	For Vista/WIN7:
	<ol>

	<li> Click in the Vista Balloon at the bottom of the page.</li>

	<li>Right mouse click on Computer and select Properties.</li>
	<li>Select Advanced System Setting. If you are asked for permissions hit continue.</li>
	<li>Select the "Environment Variables" Button at the bottom of the page</li>
	<li>In the "Systems Variables" box select "New"</li>
	<ol>
		<li>In the Variable Name: box enter devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices</li>
		<li>In the Variable value: box enter 1 then click the OK button , then click the OK button on the bottom of Environment Variables. </li>
	</ol>
	<li>Close the the windows until you are back at the <strong>Control Panel System.</strong></li>

	<li>Under Ports you should see all the devices that Windows has allocated now. 
	You can modify them and delete them if you need, but please be careful what you delete.</li>
	</ol>
	Another way to do this is:<br /> <br />
	The trick was to open the Command Prompt as administrator and 
	start the Device Manager from the same command prompt. 
	<ol><li>Right-click “Command Prompt” in Accessories and choose “Run as Administrator”</li>
	<li>Enter “set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1″ – without the quotes obviously</li>
	<li>Enter “start devmgmt.msc”</li>
	<li>In the box that opens, select “Show hidden devices” in the ‘view’ menu.</li>
	</ol>
	<br />Now if you expand the section on COM ports, all the COM ports 
		that have ever been created will be displayed, the non present ones being in grey. 
		You can uninstall away anything that you don’t want (right click, select 
		uninstall).

				<li>Test for a defective autoguider input chip. Symptom: Gemini freezes after GPS readout. 
				V1.04 checks this condition, a warning is displayed and operation is continued even

				and  connected to the Gemini's auto-guider input, causes the autoguider chip/IC to give 
				a failed condition on power-up of the Gemini., This does not mean that your Gemini is bad. 
				It just means that there are unexpected inputs on power up. So don't send you Gemini back 
				to Losmandy please. However if you are  getting this message with nothing attached, then there is a very good possibility that your Auto-Guider chip is bad, and then you would want to contact Losmandy.</li>

			Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp; Please read all this paragraph before 
			attempting to test. The problem is normally with the 
			negative voltage pump in the IC.&nbsp;This normally only takes out 
			the transmit side of the chip (sending signals to the PC) and leave 
			the receive side good. So if you cannot connect to a PC, but can 
			connect a GPS, and receive GPS updates, this is a good indication 
			also the negative voltage pump is bad. The sure fire test requires 
			voltage testing.&nbsp; You 
			can check this out if you have a good Voltmeter.&nbsp; Please do this only if 
			you feel comfortable doing this as you do it at your OWN RISK. The cap number is 
			C21 in the newer boards with the round motor cables. Measure across this cap 
			with you voltmeter with the Gemini powered up.&nbsp; It is best if you have a 
			friend do the meter reading while you hold the leads.&nbsp; Micro-leads is 
			highly recommended for this.&nbsp; The lead closest to the IC is the negative 
			lead. The side closest to the RJ22 connectors is the ground side.&nbsp; This cap 
			comes off of Pin 7 of the IC, which should be marked with 3221 if I remember 
			correctly.&nbsp; If you do not get a 5 Volt reading or close to that then the IC 
			has gone bad (or been put to sleep, see note below) and needs to be replaced.&nbsp; The Gemini is sensitive&nbsp; to 
			ground loops, and they can take this IC out.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been the 
			problem in all the cases I have found except one. That had a bad cap and broken trace.&nbsp; 
			Please NOTE that
			this chip has an auto sleep mode that can also shut down the transmit part of the IC. If the 
			IC has shut down the transmit part
			of the IC to save power, this voltage will also measure zero. To wake up the IC, 
			ask the Gemini to get GPS data, or send it a command
			such as trying to connect using GCC. Any command that requires the Gemini to send a reply should wake the IC up.&nbsp;

			Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp; Micro Resettable Fuse F2 for 
			Gemini. This fuse is a resettable fuse that protects the +5V circuit. If it 
			drops to much voltage, the processor will shut down the +5V power supply in the 
			controller. A symptom of this is the Gemini turning off the hand controller when plugging in a RS232 
			device into the RS232 Jack, or a Guider into the Guider Jack, or a GPS into the 
			Feature Port. Basically anything that causes more +5V current drain can cause 
			this symptom with a bad fuse.&nbsp; In the older Gemini&#39;s it was Green and marked X14.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your fuse is marked X14 and normally green in color, then you have the older 
			fuse. The fuse shown in the picture is the newer higher rated fuse, but still 
			green in color. It can be black in color and be the correct higher rated 
			fuse. This was a 
			known problem (according to René&nbsp; Görlich&#39;s) and later units was shipped with the 
			higher rated fuse to prevent this from happening.&nbsp; All units shipped with 
			the rocker switch should have the newer fuse.

			Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp; You would need a voltmeter to measure 
			across pins 16 and 32 of the Static Ram chip.&nbsp; This is done with power 
			off, and power disconnected from the Gemini.&nbsp; It would be safer to 
			disconnect everything from the Gemini. 
			Again, you do this at your own risk. 
			You should measure a voltage above +2.8 VDC&nbsp; If you measure less than that 
			you probably have a bad battery, or one of the steering diodes has gone out.&nbsp; 
			If you power on the Gemini this voltage should jump up to +5VDC.&nbsp; If either 
			of the voltage measurements are not correct, it is probably the steering diode 
			D1 (BAT54C Schottky diode). If both is bad then it has to be the Steering diode D1 or 
			C8 a 0.1uF cap has shorted.

			<img alt="" class="auto-style2" height="261" src="images/thumbnails/G1-GuiderInputcircuit_small1.jpg" style="float: left" width="400" /></a>				Answer: Here is a schematic of the Gemini-1 input guider circuit.&nbsp;Note 
			this is for the Gemini-1 with round motor connectors.&nbsp; 
			It can be tested with a voltmeter. You can click on the image to get 
			a larger one.&nbsp; The input jack is on the right.&nbsp; There are 
			4 pull-up, one on each input lead that pulls the inputs up to about 
			+5 Volts.&nbsp; These inputs are feed to a hex inverter IC.&nbsp; 
			(74HC04) (In the Gemini-1 units with the RJ style motor connectors, 
			this IC is missing, and the leads go directly into the 
			microprocessor.&nbsp; Also the resistors are to ground instead of 
			+5Volts)<br />
			Now if you make a test cable where you can short each input going 
			into the Guider Jack, one at a time, to Guider Pin 2, and put a 
			voltmeter on the output side of the Hex inverter, you can test each 
			input to see if it is working.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets say we short pins 2 
			and 3 together on the input.&nbsp; This would put a low signal level 
			on pin one of the IC U23.&nbsp; When this happens the pin 2 of this 
			IC should change from a low (around 0 volts) to something between 4 
			and 5 volts.&nbsp; If you do this to all the input pins one at a 
			time, and all the output are good, then the guider circuit is ok.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			If none of the outputs change, then either the IC U23 or R42 is 
			open.&nbsp; You can test to see if R42 is open by using an ohmmeter 
			(with power off on the Gemini-1) and see if it measures 100 ohms.&nbsp; 
			If it does, then more than likely U23 has gone bad.&nbsp; Note: U23 
			is not an easy IC to replace.&nbsp; It is a surface mount IC.&nbsp; 
			The best way is to cut off the leads one at a time, then remove the 
			body, and then un-solder each lead.&nbsp; Do not use too much heat, 
			as you can lift the runs and also damage the runs that run under the 
			IC.&nbsp; It is best to let a professional do this.&nbsp; Hope this 
			helps eliminate your problems.</td>

			Answer:
						I (René) can offer a solution now.<br />
						
						Gemini's SRAM is not only used to store user catalogues 
						and the observation
						logs, but also an amount of parameters and matrices used 
						for the modeling
						algorithm. So it has a size of 128 KByte and is accessed 
						(also for writing)
						very often, far exceeding size and reprogramming life 
						time of an EEPROM.<br />
						<br />
						Normally, the Li CR2032 battery should last at least one 
						year and should
						keep the SRAM content safe and the RTC running. If CMOS 
						Resets occur after
						some minutes even with a fresh battery or battery 
						lifetime is significantly
						shorter than one year, I recommend the following patch 
						for the electronically inclined:<br />
						<br />
						1) Buy a small 39k resistor (with wires, not SMD)<br />
						2) Solder it between pin 2 (the second from above at the 
						left side)<br />
						and pin 9 (the down most at the left side) of the EPSON 
						real time clock<br />
						chip labeled U2. The left side of the RTC is next to the 
						SRAM chip U9.<br />
						You can do this on the component side or the soldering 
						side of the board.<br />
						<br />
						Power Gemini on/off. Wait. The CMOS resets should be 
						gone.<br />
						<br />
						3) Remove R38 to save Li battery power. Check again.<br />
						<br />
						This was tested with three different 
						boards, one of them had CMOS Resets. All work fine.<br />
