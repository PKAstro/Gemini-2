		center the object before pushing the Alignment button to supply the

		The Model Builder is a convenient Add-On that came later. As with other 
		functions (Quick Start, Polar Align Assist, Catalog Tour) it guides 
		through the pages as a convenience. It lends a hand to a new user or 
		someone that wants to setup the mount quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; See
		<a href="/hc/En-SAE-01.html" target="_blank">Model Builder Menus</a> 
		You get to this menu in the hand controller by Menu--&gt;Funct--&gt;Modeling<br />
		<br />
		It is bad practice to mix and match these two different method, as it 
		can get quite confusing, and also mess up any model you build.&nbsp; 
		Pick one and use it, but don't go back and forth.&nbsp; Some may say, that there is a 
		certain inconsistency between both, but this can't be avoided. Many 
		users do it one way, others the other. <br />
		<br />
		If you already have a model built, using either method, and want to use it again later, you should simply GoTo 
		an object after startup, center it and push MENU-&gt;ALIGN-&gt;Synchronize. 
		This keeps the model intact but corrects for smaller offsets and time 
		differences.<br />
		<br />
		Having said this, it should be clear that pushing "Alignment" or 
		"Synchronize" on the Align screen w/o having the object centered before 
		your model will be spoiled and pointing will be off. If you have done 
		this inadvertently, there is the "Undo Last Alignment" button (which 
		works only for the very last alignment or synchronization) to make in 
		undone.<br />

		René does understand the frustration after having the telescope pointing 
		to an object and then finding nothing in the eyepiece or on the chip. In 
		fact, this was the force driving him to develop this modeling algorithm 
		8) René done the math and please believe him, no 2-star align can 
		reliably produce similar results. It is simply not possible, by the 
		underlying physical laws. Sometimes it works well (to a certain degree 
		within certain limits) and in other constellations, it will fail.<br />
		<br />
		What clearly shows up is that a new manual is needed. Please read 
		through the G1 manual, it gives the information how to use the modeling 
		the G1 way (and G2's MENU-&gt;ALIGN). Although everyone will agree on this, 
		most people won't read it, which is a shame. At least not before using the mount, 
		maybe later in case of trouble. As a computer scientist, René knows what 
		he is 
		talking about.&nbsp; As an engineer, I would write a technical manual,&nbsp; but 
		this wouldn't really help most users, too. Hopefully Hollywood chimes in 
		with some movies... <br />

		with users as a conversation with users in the users group. I just 
		removed the names from most of the text and added example links..)<br />
