		Gemini's SRAM is not only used to store user catalogues and the 
		observation<br />
		logs, but also an amount of parameters and matrices used for the 
		modelling<br />
		algorithm. So it has a size of 128 kByte and is accessed (also for 
		writing)<br />
		very often, far exceeding size and reprogramming life time of an EEPROM.<br />
		<br />
		Normally, the Li CR2032 battery should last at least one year and should<br />
		keep the SRAM content safe and the RTC running. If CMOS Resets occur 
		after<br />
		some minutes even with a fresh battery or battery lifetime is 
		significantly<br />
		shorter than one year, I recommend the following patch for the 
		electronically<br />
		inclined:<br />
		<br />
		1) Buy a small 39k resistor (with wires, not SMD)<br />
		2) Solder it between pin 2 (the second from above at the left side)<br />
		and pin 9 (the downmost at the left side) of the EPSON real time clock<br />
		chip labeled U2. The left side of the RTC is next to the SRAM chip U9.<br />
		You can do this on the component side or the soldering side of the 
		board.<br />
		<br />
		Power Gemini on/off. Wait. The CMOS resets should be gone.<br />
		<br />
		3) Remove R38 to save Li battery power. Check again.<br />
		<br />
		I've tested this modification with three different boards, one of them 
		had<br />
		CMOS Resets. All work fine.<br />
