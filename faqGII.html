	Answer:
	<br />
		WARNING: The Battery circuit in Gemini-2 is much different than in Gemini-1.
		The battery connects through a small .2v Zener diode directly into the ARM processor.
		<span class="smalltext"> <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/LPC2388.pdf" target="_blank">The Data sheet LPC2388.pdf
		</a>states Vi(VBAT), the separate input for the RTC and the SRAM, has to have 2.0V at minimum, 
		typical 3.3V and 3.6V at max for operation.</span> With the Zener diode inline, that means that a 
		battery voltage between 2.2V and not exceeding 3.8V would be acceptable. A note 
		states that the RTC typically fails at 1.6V (1.8V at the battery). 
		<em>This means that
		connecting an external Battery pack in place of the internal 3.3V 
		battery will probably damage the ARM processor, So, <b>DON'T DO IT!</b></em>
		<br><br>After replacing the battery, power on Gemini-2 and set the time and date. Failure to do so
		could cause the processor to draw too much power from the battery and might result in processor damage.&nbsp; 
		You can also save all your setting using the Web interface Firmware/SRAM 
		page "Store SRAM" content to a file before removing the battery, and then "Load SRAM" content from 
		file to restore all the setting after you replace the battery.&nbsp; This will not set the date and time, you still must do this! 
		<br><br>Here is a
		<a href="javascript:localURL('videos/Losmandy_Gemini_Battery_CR2354.mp4')" target="_self">
		video</a> showing how to change the CR2350 battery. <br>Here is a
		<a href="javascript:localURL('videos/Losmandy_Gemini_Battery_CR2450.mp4')" target="_self">
		video</a> showing how to change the CR2450 battery in Gemini-2 Mini. <br />
		<br />
		When Losmandy receives the circuit boards, the battery has a piece 
		of insulating material inserted between the positive contact and the battery 
		to keep it from powering the ARM processor.&nbsp; 
		What Losmandy does first, is to power up Gemini-2, set the time and date, then pull out the the insulation.&nbsp; This way, the ARM processor does not have a chance to 
		pull excessive current.&nbsp; You can emulate that on the original 
		Gemini-2 version by putting a small piece of plastic or paper on top of the new 
		battery before putting it in.&nbsp; Then power up Gemini-2, set the 
		date and time and remove the insulation.</td>

	Answer:
			<ul>
				<li> The new unit (Gemini-2 Mini) is physically smaller
				</li>
				<li> The new unit has only one power connector</li>
				<li> The Classic hand controller jack has been eliminated.&nbsp; 
				The new hand control has the same version of 
				the switches that is on the back of the Graphics hand control, 
				so there is no need for a classic hand controller jack</li>
				<li> The DEC and RA connectors have been rotated 90 degrees, so 
				that right angle connectors if used will not interfere with 
				other connectors</li>
				<li> The PCB has been completely redesigned, with all the latest 
				components and fixes applied</li>
				<li> The front panel connectors have been totally rearranged</li>
				<li> Serial Port 1 now has been relabeled "Serial Port/GPS"</li>
				<li> Serial Port 2 now has been relabeled "HC"</li>
				<li> The new unit battery has been changed to the readily available CR2450 which has a slightly higher mAH rating than the previous CR2354.

				The battery holder has been changed to something much less damaging to one's finger nails. The cell snaps into place, and releases with a simple move.

		<a name="Q3"></a>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you do if you have two or more Gemini-2 
		controllers on the your network
		</td>

	<tr>
		<td class="style6">
			<br>Answer: Gemini-2 has a default IP address of 192.168.0.111, and a default MAC address of 1e:30:6c:a2:45:5f.&nbsp; 
			These are set by the firmware an are changeable. If you have more than one Gemini-2 on a local network, you will have to change
			both the IP address and MAC address in the second one. If you have more than 2 
			then change the others, as well.<br><br>
			You can change the last digit 
			of the MAC address. The MAC address of a Gemini-2 can be anything between 0 and F (Hex 
			for 16). It is also best to use static IP to be safe, so turn off
			DHCP by unchecking it's box.&nbsp;Do this by going to http://current IP address of Gemini-2 you are going to change/network.cgi&nbsp; 
			Example would be <a href="http://192.168.0.111/network.cgi">
			http://192.168.0.111/network.cgi</a> and changing the IP address to 
			192.168.0.110 in both Current Setting and Stored Setting boxes, then uncheck the DHCP box 
			and also change the MAC address from 1e:30:6c:a2:45:5f to 
			1e:30:6c:a2:45:5e etc. Change both the Current Setting and the 
			Stored Setting and then hit "Set". When you do this, you will have to reopen the browser page by 
			putting in the new IP address.<br><br> It can also be done on the hand 
			controller, but that does not set the default IP address, just the 
			current IP address.&nbsp; Also if you are using ASCOM Gemini.net 
			driver, it can only address one mount per computer at a time.&nbsp; 
			You will have to have multiple computers with the ASCOM Gemini.net 
			driver on each, and the Ethernet IP address set correctly and DHCP 
			turned off, or change the IP address configured in Gemini.net each time you want to connect to a different controller.
			On a local network you cannot have any two devices 
			using the same IP address.&nbsp; If you also change the MAC address, if 
			by some chance you do use DHCP, then the router will automatically assign 
			a different IP address to each Gemini-2. You can see 
			<a href="web/web-network_change_mac.html" target="_self"> 
			instructions</a> on how to do this.&nbsp; After making these changes you can store these settings 
			to the Micro-SDcard by going to <a href="http://ip/">http://IP</a> 
			address of the unit you are working on/firmware.cgi and hitting 
			Store SRAM.&nbsp; The example page is
			<a href="web/web-firmware-sram.html" target="_self">
			here</a>.&nbsp; It can also be stored in the latest version 1.20 or newer of 
			the hand controller using the Menu--&gt;System--&gt;"STORE" button.<br /><br /></td>

	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td class="style6">
			<br>Answer: Gemini-2 original has two barrel connector inputs (Gemini-2 Mini 
			only has one) much like what is 
			used on laptop computers.&nbsp; The outside diameter is 5.5mm and 
			the inside diameter is 2.1mm.&nbsp; Gemini-2 is designed to be 
			able to provide a absolute maximum of 2.8 amps to each motor. The 
			Gemini-2 is fused at 5 amps on the inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gemini-2 is not 
			designed to function on voltage less than +12 volts and can work all 
			the way up to +18 volts safely.&nbsp; I recommend at least a +5 amp 
			12 volt switching power supply.&nbsp;The reason for the 5 amps is 
			that some power supplies will drop the voltage below it's rating 
			when higher amperage is required, like slewing.&nbsp;&nbsp; This needs to be a good 
			quality power supply, and many of the lower cost units puts out a 
			lot of voltage spikes and are not well regulated.&nbsp; You have 
			invested $1000.00 in Gemini-2, so don't skimp on the power 
			supply. I personally use a 16V 7 Amp medical rated power supply.&nbsp; 
			Sorry they are not made anymore as it was quite reasonable at $80.00 
			and has performed quite well for both my Gemini-1 unit and now my 
			Gemini-2 unit. The 16 volts seems to be a sweet spot where both the 
			G1 and G2 works well at. A very similar unit by the same company but

		<td class="style6">
			<br>Answer: The simple answer is No.&nbsp; Almost all USB dongles where they are WiFi, or 
			BlueTooth, are slave devices, and requires the device that they are being 
			plugged into to: 1. recognize it, and 2. configure them. The Gemini 2 does not 
			have the firmware (smarts) to do this Yet.&nbsp; There is no way to load a driver

			<br><br>Answer: Yes it can.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="style6">
		At this time you will need to use two free 
			programs to insure that it can.&nbsp; The first is the ASCOM 
			Gemini.net driver and the second is what is called
			<a href="http://www.mainsequencesoftware.com/Products/WiFiScope" target="_blank">WiFi Scope</a>. WiFi Scope is a free program, but they do ask for a 
			donation.&nbsp; Using both together will allow SkySafari to connect 
			through WiFi Scope to the ASCOM Gemini.net driver into Gemini-2 
			and control it.&nbsp; SkySafari runs on an
			<a href="https://skysafariastronomy.com/skysafari-6-professional-astronomy-telescope-control-software-for-ios.html" target="_blank">

			<a href="https://skysafariastronomy.com/skysafari-6-professional-astronomy-telescope-control-software-for-android.html" target="_blank">
			Android</a> device.<br /><br>
			WiFi Scope is a PC application.&nbsp; Once you have an Ethernet 
			connection with the Gemini, using either the Netgear or D-Link 
			Bridges above, (or a wired connection) then connect WiFi scope to 
			Gemini-2 (Ascom connection) first, and then SkySafari to WiFi 
			scope.&nbsp; There is a small (or maybe larger) problem with 
			SkySafari when using it with Ethernet.&nbsp; It opens up a new 
			socket for each command it sends to Gemini-2.&nbsp; This can 
			eventually overload Gemini-2 ethernet stack.&nbsp; This does not 
			happen when using SkySafari with a serial port.<br />

			<br>Answer: Yes.&nbsp; 
			Any file that is placed into the SDcard HCFirmware sub-directory

			correctly, so that it shows up during power up of the hand 
			controller, as the boot up logo.&nbsp; If the file is gemhc.bin 
			firmware update, then it will be uploaded to the root of the micro 
			SDcard in the hand controller, and then flashed as an updated firmware.&nbsp;
			<a href="hcfirmwareflashexample.html" target="_self">See HC Flashing

		<a name="Q9"></a>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are there so many different ways of updating the firmware 
		in the main Gemini-2 unit? 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="style6">
			<br>Answer: That is a good question. However the answer is a little 
			complex.&nbsp; To update the firmware, the basic idea is to place a 
			programming file at the root of the Main Gemini-2 unit SDcard.  If this file is named 
			"HGM_Gem2.bin", then Gemini-2 will 
			reprogram itself on the next power up and rename the file "Cur_Gem2.bin".&nbsp; 
			After programming this Cur_Gem2.bin file can be deleted with no harm.<br />
			If the file is named "NewGem.bin", then the web interface has to be used to tell Gemini-2 to
			use this file and flash the program.&nbsp; The file will not be 
			renamed.&nbsp; After programming this file can be deleted with no 
			harm.<br />
			The differences are primarily in the method that you use to get one of these 
			two files to the root
			of the SDcard.  There are basically 5 ways:
			<ol>
			<li>Use the web interface and upload one of these files to the root 
			of the SDcard.</li>
				<li>Use a FTP program and place&nbsp;one of these files at 
				the root of the SDcard.</li>
				<li>Remove the SDcard, and use a card reader to place one of 
				these files at the root of the SDcard.</li>
				<li>All the update files are also stored as a combined.zip file, 
				that updates both the main unit and the hand controller at the 
				same time.&nbsp; All these files and catalogs can be put on the 
				micro SDcard with&nbsp; an FTP process.</li>
				<li>There is now a utility that can be used to upload the 
				combined.zip file using a Windows computer
				<a href="gfu.html" target="_self">GFU 
				for Windows</a>.</li>
			</ol>  
			After the file is at the root, the ways to cause Gemini-2 to flash itself depend on the file type uploaded, as described above.<br />
			Note: There are no differences in the NewGem.bin file and the HGM_Cur2.bin file except the file name. You can 
			convert one to the other just by renaming it.

		2000, XP, Vista &amp; Win7 to show all the com ports that have been allocated
		</td></tr>
		<tr>
		<td class="style6">Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows does not normally show non-connected devices in device manager. This is even true if you turn on show 			hidden devices under the view tab. Before you do this change, be for warned - that this will let you modify/delete devices that you might not want 			changed or deleted.  You do this at your own risk! With that said here is a step by step process. 
	<br /><br />
	For 2000 and XP:

	<ol>
	<li>Right mouse click on My Computer and select Properties.</li>

	<li>Select the Advanced tab.</li>

	<li>Select the "Environment Variables" Button at the bottom above the "Ok" Button</li>

	<li>In the "Systems Variables" box select "New"</li>

	<li>A box will Popup that has 2 entry blocks.</li>

	<ol>
		<li>In the Variable Name: box enter devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices</li>
		<li>In the Variable value: box enter 1 then click the OK button , then click the OK button on the bottom of Environment Variables. </li>
	</ol>

	<li>Close the Hardware manager, and System Properties windows.</li>
	<li>Use step one above to reopen System Properties and select the Hardware tab.</li>
	<li>Select the Device manager. </li>
	<li>Under the View menu, select show hidden devices. </li>
	<li>Under Ports you should see all the devices that Windows has allocated now. You can modify them and delete them if you need, but please be careful what 	you delete.</li>
	</ol>

	For Vista/WIN7:
	<ol>

	<li> Click in the Vista Balloon at the bottom of the page.</li>

	<li>Right mouse click on Computer and select Properties.</li>
	<li>Select Advanced System Setting. If you are asked for permissions hit continue.</li>
	<li>Select the "Environment Variables" Button at the bottom of the page</li>
	<li>In the "Systems Variables" box select "New"</li>
	<ol>
		<li>In the Variable Name: box enter devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices</li>
		<li>In the Variable value: box enter 1 then click the OK button , then click the OK button on the bottom of Environment Variables. </li>
	</ol>
	<li>Close the the windows until you are back at the <strong>Control Panel System.</strong></li>
	<li>Select Device Manager</li>
	<li>Under the View menu, select show hidden devices. </li>
	<li>Under Ports you should see all the devices that Windows has allocated now. 
	You can modify them and delete them if you need, but please be careful what you delete.</li>
	</ol>
	Another way to do this is:<br /> <br />
	The trick was to open the Command Prompt as administrator and 
	start the Device Manager from the same command prompt. 
	<ol><li>Right-click “Command Prompt” in Accessories and choose “Run as Administrator”</li>
	<li>Enter “set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1″ – without the quotes obviously</li>
	<li>Enter “start devmgmt.msc”</li>
	<li>In the box that opens, select “Show hidden devices” in the ‘view’ menu.</li>
	</ol>
	<br />Now if you expand the section on COM ports, all the COM ports 
		that have ever been created will be displayed, the non present ones being in grey. 
		You can uninstall away anything that you don’t want (right click, select 
		uninstall).&nbsp;
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		Also there is a USB port scanner that will tell you every USB port and 
		it's assignment.&nbsp; See

			<br>Answer: Nope this is wrong.&nbsp; 
		Modeling only helps provide for better GO-TO's.&nbsp; The only thing 
		that really helps accurate tracking is an excellent Polar alignment.<br />
		If your polar alignment is dead on, and your time, time zone offset, 
		latitude and longitude are dead on, then the G2 should provide accurate 
		tracking, but of course other factors such as gear slop, mount 
		imperfections, balance imperfections, and atmospheric refraction can 
		cause tracking errors, so you might not see perfect tracking, even if 
			you have a perfect polar alignment.

		<a name="Q17"></a>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Info from Craig Stark about PHD and Guiding with Gemini-2. This limitation has no effect on RA guiding
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="style6">
			<br>Answer: Here's what people can do:
<ol><li>
	Calibration:  Set you calibration step size to be, say 100 ms or
more.  I doubt anyone is below this though as the default is 750 ms.
If set to something far above 75 ms, you are not getting short pulses
during calibration.  Therefore, if you are having a problem during
calibration, it is not because the pulses are too short and thus being
ignored.

** If you want to play with things to see what gets ignored and what
doesn't, set this to some value and use the Manual Guide tool.  Each
time you press a button, it will send out a single pulse of
"Calibration Step size" in duration.  Is it ignored or is it listened
to?

</li>
	<li>
	Dec guiding mode: Keep in mind that if a short command is ignored
during normal guiding, the next one will be bigger as more error has
built up.  In Dec, if you're drifting at 30 msec worth of guiding per
frame (i.e., it would take 30 ms to bring it back), the first time we
send 30ms.  If this is ignored, we've built up more error -- 60ms.  If
this is ignored (as it's too short), the next time, we send 90ms and
so we bring it back.  This exact scheme will take place if you use
"Resist switch " or the N or S only guiding.  The Lowpass mode will
send shorter pulses, so you'll want to avoid that mode.  In RA,
there's nothing like the lowpass filter mode, so if error builds up,
longer pulses will go out.

</li>
	<li>
	Enforcing a min pulse duration: PHD lets you specify a max pulse
duration but not a min one.  It does let you specify a min motion
parameter though.  To turn this into a min duration, you need a number
that's found in the log file.  Right before the main log info you'll
see a bit that lists the RA angle and rate and the Dec angle and rate.
 These rates are the number of pixels the image will move per msec of
a guide pulse.  So, it might be 0.007.  If so, we know that 100 msec
of a pulse would lead to a 0.7 pixel motion.  Thus, if we set the
min-motion parameter to 0.7, we'll never send pulses less than 100 ms.

Personally, though, I'd not do #3.  I'd use "Resist-switch" as my
algorithm, let it send short pulses that get ignored and let the error
build up a bit.  When they don't get ignored, the correction gets
applied and we start all over again.

			<br>Answer:  <ol class="auto-style6"><li>You need to do a calibration on 
				the hand controller LCD alignment,<br /> See 
			<a href="quickstart/index.html" target="_self">/quickstart/index.html</a>
			The reason for this is that there are hidden switches at the bottom of the screen, 
			that are normally covered by the plastic case.&nbsp; But if the 
			screen has not been calibrated, then the touch screen can be moved 
			up electrically which effectively moves these hidden switches where 
			a finger can hit them.&nbsp; Hitting these switches can change the language
			without having to go through the menus. This is so that pictures of each screen could be taken for tutorials with the
			cover removed.  </li>
				<li>The other thing is that there is a gasket all the way around the LCD.  If it gets too tight on the bottom, it
			could also be pressing on these switches.  If aligning the screen does not fix it, you might want to back off the screws that holds the front cover on about a quarter of turn or so.</li>
				<li>Now once you have calibrated the switches, they should hold 
			calibration, even through a power off and on.&nbsp; But if firmware 
			is updated, then they would need to be recalibrated.&nbsp; Also 
			extreme temperature changes might effect the calibration.</li></ol></td>

		<br>Answer: This error message normally means that the Autoguider input is receiving invalid inputs. If the autoguider input receives both a

		In the past this has mostly been caused by the SBIG brand of cameras when they were powered off and the Gemini is powered on. The most common solution to this is:
			<ol>
				<li>Turn on the camera before turning on the Gemini, and turn off 
				the Gemini before turning off the Camera</li>
				<li>Get an SBIG relay box for the camera</li>
				<li>Purchase or build an opto-Isolator for the Gemini/camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;  You cannot use the old Optocoupler that Losmandy sold, on Gemini-2. It's signal levels are not compatible.
