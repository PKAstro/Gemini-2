		<td>Please note that TheSkyX as of March 2013 will support the ASCOM interface, when the Dec 28 Update and daily builds of March 2013 
		and later are installed.&nbsp; You do not need to install any plugins for TheSkyX and the Gemini.net ASCOM driver to communicate with each other 
		such as TeleAPI, which was needed in the past.&nbsp; 
		Please make sure you have the latest version, latest update and the 
		<span class="style2"><strong>latest daily 
		downloads</strong> </span>available on the Software Bisque site. 
		<span class="style2"><strong>Please note that you 
		need to download the latest Update (Dec 2012) and the Daily build of theSkyX. The Dec 2012 update 
		does not provide for the new ASCOM driver interface. It has to have the 
		latest the daily download, also installed.</strong></span><br /><br />You will have to also install 
		the
		<a href="https://github.com/ASCOMInitiative/ASCOMPlatform/releases/download/v6.5Release/ASCOMPlatform65.exe" target="_blank">
		ASCOM 6.5</a> interface from the ASCOM web site, and the ASCOM 
		Gemini.net driver to use the ASCOM driver with theSkyX if you what to 
		use the ASCOM Gemini.net driver in addition to the above updates to 
		theSkyX.&nbsp; Now software like MaxomDL and PHD need the ASCOM driver 
		if you want to do Pulse Guiding instead of guiding with the ST4 port.

			the Gemini.net driver up and running. Also both programs have to be 
			either running in non-administrator&nbsp; mode or administrator 
			mode.&nbsp; We recomment that you do not run in adminstrator mode. <br />
			(Do this only in if you have to: If you right click on both program's icons and select 
			run as administrator, then hopefully that will fix them not seeing 
			each other.&nbsp; But if you do this, then any other program you 
			need to use the ASCOM Gemini-net driver with will have to be opened 
			the same way.&nbsp; So if you are not seeing the ASCOM selection, 
			the close theSkyX, and open both theSkyX and Gemini.net in Admin 
			mode and start over at step 2, but leave the Gemini.net running )</li>
