		<td class="style6"><font class="post">OK, in the interest of benefiting 
		others contemplating upgrading their G11 gearboxes to McLennan 
		gearboxes, I have compiled a shopping list of items to make the 
		transition to these gearboxes as simple as possible. The reason I am 
		posting this shopping list is because I have found that the information 
		available on the web is mostly out of date or provides for a less than 
		ideal solution (for example wrapping tape around the screws to make them 
		a tighter fit).<br />
		<br />
		First of all, you will need to purchase the gearbox. I ordered mine from 
		RS Components. I got two, one for RA and one for DEC. The idea was that 
		if I upgraded both gearboxes then I it is simpler to set up in the 
		Gemini controller <br />

		McLennan P5-G11</a> <br />
		<br />
		Next I ordered the gearbox adapter kit on this link. This kit gives you 
		a pinion gear that already has the 3mm bore needed for the latest high 
		torque motors that are fitted on all current models of the G11.

		DCMotor Gearbox adaptor kit, 12.5:1 - 125:1</a> <br />
		<br />
		3/16" external diameter 0.014" wall thickness brass or aluminum tubing. 
		This can be obtained from many hobby stores. I got mine from ebay. The 
		problem with this is that it is a slightly loose fit, so you will need 
		Red Loctite to make sure it holds.<br />
		<br />
		Red Loctite, I got some other brand of this since I couldn't find red 
		Loctite in retail in Oman.<br />
		<br />
		A 4 - 40 drill and tap set, obtainable from most hardware stores. This 
		is so that you can use the original screws that came with the motor for 
		a secure fit.<br />
		<br />
		A 4 mm drill bit to be used to widen the mounting holes on the ears that 
		stick out of the sides of the gear box.<br />
		<br />
		A Dremel tool with a cutting disk will be useful for cutting the tubing.<br />
		<br />
		Steps for installation:<br />
		1) Drill out the mounting holes that stick out of the sides of the 
		gearbox to 4mm. Then clean thoroughly before proceeding to next step so 
		as not to get the gear box innards dirty.<br />
		<br />
		2) Disassemble gearbox cover, taking note of the position of the parts 
		just in case it falls apart and you have to put it back together.<br />
		<br />
		3) Locate the two screw holes used to mount the motor onto the gearbox. 
		Drill and tap these using your drill and tap 4-40 set. This will allow 
		you to use the original screws that came with the motor. Make sure you 
		do this with the plate you are drilling far from the gearbox so as not 
		to drop metal shavings inside. Clean thoroughly when done.<br />
		<br />
		4) Re-assemble gearbox, use Loctite on the screws to prevent them from 
		getting loose int he future.<br />
		<br />
		5) Cut a bit of the brass tube long enough to cover most of the output 
		shaft from the gearbox. This should not be so long as to touch the brass 
		bearing at the base of the shaft. Clean this cut piece of tube 
		thoroughly and file away any burs resulting from the cutting process.<br />
		<br />
		6) Put the sleeve on the gearbox output shaft and glue in place using 
		red loctite, dont drip any into the bearing or you might ruin the 
		gearbox. This tube is used to increase the diameter of the output shaft 
		for a snug fit in the coupler.<br />
		<br />
		7) After curing the glue, drill out a small hole over the flat on the 
		output shaft. This will help secure the coupler by giving the grub screw 
		something to latch onto.<br />
		<br />
		8) Now assemble everything and change the mount type to MI 250 on the 
		Gemini unit (assuming you have changed both)<br />
		<br />
		Pictures coming soon, this website will help you visualize what I said, 
		but it does not match my instructions as I have made some modifications 
		to the instructions.
