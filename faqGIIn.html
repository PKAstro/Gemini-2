                                                        <span class="smalltext"> <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/LPC2388.pdf" target="_blank">The Data sheet LPC2388.pdf
		</a>states Vi(VBAT), the separate input for the RTC and the SRAM, has to have 2.0V at minimum, 
		typical 3.3V and 3.6V at max for operation.</span> With the Zener diode inline, that means that a battery voltage between 2.2V and not exceeding 3.8V would be acceptable. A note states that the
                                                        RTC typically fails at 1.6V (1.8V at the battery).
                                                        <em>This means that
		connecting an external Battery pack in place of the internal 3.3V

                                                        damage.&nbsp; You can also save all your setting using the Web interface Firmware/SRAM page "Store SRAM" content to a file before removing the battery, and then "Load SRAM" content from file to restore
                                                        all the setting after you replace the battery.&nbsp; This will not set the date and time, you still must do this!

                                                        <br /> When Losmandy receives the circuit boards, the battery has a piece of insulating material inserted between the positive contact and the battery to keep it from powering the ARM processor.&nbsp;
                                                        What Losmandy does first, is to power up Gemini-2, set the time and date, then pull out the the insulation.&nbsp; This way, the ARM processor does not have a chance to pull excessive current.&nbsp;
                                                        You can emulate that on the original Gemini-2 version by putting a small piece of plastic or paper on top of the new battery before putting it in.&nbsp; Then power up Gemini-2, set the date and time
                                                        and remove the insulation.

                                                        Gemini-2 has a default IP address of 192.168.0.111, and a default MAC address of 1e:30:6c:a2:45:5f.&nbsp; These are set by the firmware an are changeable. If you have more than one Gemini-2 on a local network, you will have to change both the IP address
                                                        and MAC address in the second one. If you have more than 2 then change the others, as well.<br><br> You can change the last digit of the MAC
                                                        address. The MAC address of a Gemini-2 can be anything between 0 and F (Hex for 16). It is also best to use static IP to be safe, so turn off DHCP by unchecking it's box.&nbsp;Do this by going to
                                                        http://current IP address of Gemini-2 you are going to change/network.cgi&nbsp; Example would be <a href="http://192.168.0.111/network.cgi">
			http://192.168.0.111/network.cgi</a> and changing the IP address to 192.168.0.110 in both Current Setting and Stored Setting boxes, then uncheck the DHCP box and also change the MAC address from 1e:30:6c:a2:45:5f to 1e:30:6c:a2:45:5e etc. Change both
                                                        the Current Setting and the Stored Setting and then hit "Set". When you do this, you will have to reopen the browser page by putting in the new IP address.<br><br> It can also be done on the hand
                                                        controller, but that does not set the default IP address, just the current IP address.&nbsp; Also if you are using ASCOM Gemini.net driver, it can only address one mount per computer at a time.&nbsp;
                                                        You will have to have multiple computers with the ASCOM Gemini.net driver on each, and the Ethernet IP address set correctly and DHCP turned off, or change the IP address configured in Gemini.net
                                                        each time you want to connect to a different controller. On a local network you cannot have any two devices using the same IP address.&nbsp; If you also change the MAC address, if by some chance
                                                        you do use DHCP, then the router will automatically assign a different IP address to each Gemini-2. You can see

                                                        Gemini-2 original has two barrel connector inputs (Gemini-2 Mini only has one) much like what is used on laptop computers.&nbsp; The outside diameter is 5.5mm and the inside diameter is 2.1mm.&nbsp; Gemini-2 is designed to be able to provide a absolute
                                                        maximum of 2.8 amps to each motor. The Gemini-2 is fused at 5 amps on the inputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gemini-2 is not designed to function on voltage less than +12 volts and can work all the way up
                                                        to +18 volts safely.&nbsp; I recommend at least a +5 amp 12 volt switching power supply.&nbsp;The reason for the 5 amps is that some power supplies will drop the voltage below it's rating when higher

                                                        That is a good question. However the answer is a little complex.&nbsp; To update the firmware, the basic idea is to place a programming file at the root of the Main Gemini-2 unit SDcard. If this file is named "HGM_Gem2.bin", then Gemini-2 will reprogram
                                                        itself on the next power up and rename the file "Cur_Gem2.bin".&nbsp; After programming this Cur_Gem2.bin file can be deleted with no harm.<br
                                                        /> If the file is named "NewGem.bin", then the web interface has to be used to tell Gemini-2 to use this file and flash the program.&nbsp; The file will not be renamed.&nbsp; After programming this
                                                        file can be deleted with no harm.
                                                        <br /> The differences are primarily in the method that you use to get one of these two files to the root of the SDcard. There are basically 5 ways:
                                                        <ol>
                                                            <li>Use the web interface and upload one of these files to the root of the SDcard.</li>
                                                            <li>Use a FTP program and place&nbsp;one of these files at the root of the SDcard.</li>
                                                            <li>Remove the SDcard, and use a card reader to place one of these files at the root of the SDcard.</li>
                                                            <li>All the update files are also stored as a combined.zip file, that updates both the main unit and the hand controller at the same time.&nbsp; All these files and catalogs can be put on the micro
                                                                SDcard with&nbsp; an FTP process.</li>
                                                            <li>There is now a utility that can be used to upload the combined.zip file using a Windows computer
                                                                <a href="gfu.html" target="_self">GFU

                                                        </ol>
                                                        After the file is at the root, the ways to cause Gemini-2 to flash itself depend on the file type uploaded, as described above.<br /> Note: There are no differences in the NewGem.bin file and the
                                                        HGM_Cur2.bin file except the file name. You can convert one to the other just by renaming it.

                                                            <li>Enter “set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1″ – without the quotes obviously</li>
                                                            <li>Enter “start devmgmt.msc”</li>
                                                            <li>In the box that opens, select “Show hidden devices” in the ‘view’ menu.</li>

                                                        <br />Now if you expand the section on COM ports, all the COM ports that have ever been created will be displayed, the non present ones being in grey. You can uninstall away anything that you don’t
                                                        want (right click, select uninstall).&nbsp;

                                                        dead on, and your time, time zone offset, latitude and longitude are dead on, then the G2 should provide accurate tracking, but of course other factors such as gear slop, mount imperfections, balance
                                                        imperfections, and atmospheric refraction can cause tracking errors, so you might not see perfect tracking, even if you have a perfect polar alignment.

                                                        Here's what people can do:
                                                        <ol>
                                                            <li>
                                                                Calibration: Set you calibration step size to be, say 100 ms or more. I doubt anyone is below this though as the default is 750 ms. If set to something far above 75 ms, you are not getting short pulses during calibration. Therefore, if you are having
                                                                a problem during calibration, it is not because the pulses are too short and thus being ignored. ** If you want to play with things to see what gets ignored and what doesn't, set this to
                                                                some value and use the Manual Guide tool. Each time you press a button, it will send out a single pulse of "Calibration Step size" in duration. Is it ignored or is it listened to?

                                                            </li>
                                                            <li>
                                                                Dec guiding mode: Keep in mind that if a short command is ignored during normal guiding, the next one will be bigger as more error has built up. In Dec, if you're drifting at 30 msec worth of guiding per frame (i.e., it would take 30 ms to bring it back),
                                                                the first time we send 30ms. If this is ignored, we've built up more error -- 60ms. If this is ignored (as it's too short), the next time, we send 90ms and so we bring it back. This exact
                                                                scheme will take place if you use "Resist switch " or the N or S only guiding. The Lowpass mode will send shorter pulses, so you'll want to avoid that mode. In RA, there's nothing like the
                                                                lowpass filter mode, so if error builds up, longer pulses will go out.

                                                            </li>
                                                            <li>
                                                                Enforcing a min pulse duration: PHD lets you specify a max pulse duration but not a min one. It does let you specify a min motion parameter though. To turn this into a min duration, you need a number that's found in the log file. Right before the main
                                                                log info you'll see a bit that lists the RA angle and rate and the Dec angle and rate. These rates are the number of pixels the image will move per msec of a guide pulse. So, it might be
                                                                0.007. If so, we know that 100 msec of a pulse would lead to a 0.7 pixel motion. Thus, if we set the min-motion parameter to 0.7, we'll never send pulses less than 100 ms. Personally, though,
                                                                I'd not do #3. I'd use "Resist-switch" as my algorithm, let it send short pulses that get ignored and let the error build up a bit. When they don't get ignored, the correction gets applied
                                                                and we start all over again.

To do this, the plate solving software must be able to issue a Sync command to Gemini.net ASCOM Driver.&nbsp; You'll need to set this setting in the Gemini.net ASCOM
                                                        driver: &nbsp;"Sync performs additional align". Then, each Sync from the plate solve coordinates will add an additional data point to the Gemini model.

Windows 8 and 8.1 will not let you turn off UAC.&nbsp; If UAC is turned off in Windows 7, then File Explorer will act as if it had been started in admin mode, and
                                                        should have full file privileges.&nbsp; Because you cannot use Windows file explorer in full admin mode with Windows 8 or 8.1, you will probably have to use an external FTP program such as FileZilla
                                                        to access the micro SDcard contents instead of Windows File Explorer.&nbsp; Now if you are using Windows 7 File Explorer and you try to delete a file on the micro SDcard, and get a permissions error,
                                                        go into the Windows Control Panel\User Accounts and change the UAC to off (lowest setting.)&nbsp; When you finish, please make sure you restore the setting back.
