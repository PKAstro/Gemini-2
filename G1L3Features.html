            <h3>DC Servo motors</h3>
            <p>
              Servo motors have the advantage of a huge dynamic speed range.
              They track smoothly even at the lowest guiding speed consuming
              very low current but can ramp up to high speeds while delivering
              high torque.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each axis is controlled by a dedicated micro-controller.</li>

                1450x sidereal
                rate (6 degrees per second) f.i. for the G11, even more (about
                1900x) for the Titan.
                <br>
                800x is recommended for the HGM-200 and Titan mounts, up to
                1200x for the G11.</li>

              <li>Custom usage supported by Gemini's native command set</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Focusing</h3>
            <p>Gemini supports focusing units having 9
              to 12 volt DC motors (e.g. JMI's NGF series). In order to focus
              using the Gemini, you must have an adapter board accessory
              connected
              to the feature port.</p>
            <p>The Gemini focusing function uses the Meade
              LX-200 serial line focusing commands. You can also change focus
              using the hand controller by putting it into focus mode. This is
              done by selecting "Focusing" from the Quick Menu. This
              menu item is only available if the adapter board was connected.
              When
              in Focus Mode, the RA buttons move in and out, and the dec buttons
              toggle between fast and slow focusing modes.</p>
            <p>To disengage from the Focus Mode, press the
              Menu button.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Internal databases</b></h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Database objects are stored with coordinates, type, size,
                magnitude.
                <br>
                Objects are precessed to the current date, corrected for
                refraction.</li>
              <li><b>All</b> objects of the Revised NGC/IC catalog are
                contained,
                <br>
                by courtesy of Wolfgang Steinicke, the NGC/IC project.</li>
              <li>Messier and Sharpless 2 catalog. SAO stars up to 7m1
                magnitude.</li>

                Planetary Objects catalog, including most objects of the PK
                (Perek, Kohoutek) catalog</li>
              <li>1802 Dark Nebulae from Lynds' Catalog of Dark Nebulae&gt;</li>
              <li>1125 Bright Nebulae from Lynds' Catalog of Bright Nebulae</li>
              .
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3><b>User Defined Database</b></h3>
            <p>A user defined database with up to about 4000 objects can be
              uploaded using
              serial communication and are stored in the battery backuped SRAM
              memory. This feature can f.i. be used to store the observing
              program for a night.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>Observing Log</b></h3>
            <p>Many user actions, f.i. startup and shutdown, object selections,
              GoTo operations are logged and stored into the SRAM memory
              together with timestamps and coordinates.
              This log can be uploaded and used to build the user's observing
              log.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Gemini Starts Up Aligned</h3>
            <p>
              Gemini can slew to the first alignment star if the mount is
              polar-aligned
              and the OTA is in a defined home position during startup. This
              feature also requires that Gemini have the correct latitude,
              longitude and UTC data.</p>
            <h3>Sophisticated Telescope Pointing Model</h3>
            <p>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first alignment after startup synchronizes the telescope's
                position with the sky.</li>
              <li>Subsequent Additional Alignments can be used to build or
                refine a pointing model.</li>
              <li>Up to 255 alignments are possible at each side of the meridian
                to refine the model.</li>
              <li>After the first Additional Alignments model parameters A
                (Polar misalignment in Azimuth)
                and E (in Elevation) are calculated.</li>
              <li>The first alignment at the opposite site of the meridian </li>
              <li>After the third Additional Alignment the nonperpendicularities
                of the mount/OTA combination are taken into account: NP
                (nonperpendicularity at the pole) and NE (at the equator).</li>
              <li>After the fifth Additional Alignment the internal telescope
                pointing model is extended to include "Counterweight Flexure,"
                a refinement that takes account of the play and flexure in the
                RA
                axis assembly.</li>
              <li>Alignments can be done using any bright star, database or PC
                transferred object, east or west of the meridian.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Simplified Sync Operation using TheSky</h3>
            <p>
              From Level 3, V1.01 up every location marked within the
              planetarium program
              TheSky can be used to
              synchronize Gemini's coordinate system without having to slew to
              the location
              before. This simplifies Sync and Image Link operations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Polar Axis Correction</h3>
            <p>This feature assists you in accurately polar
              aligning your mount. Because Gemini's modeling feature calculates
              the mount's deviation from correct polar alignment, it can be used
              to
              guide you as you adjust the mounts altitude and elevation to
              achieve
              polar alignment.</p>
            <p>After you have done several alignments on
              different objects, select an object from the Object Database that
              is
              near the celestial equator and the meridian. Goto the object and
              center it in the eyepiece using the HC buttons. Now, select "Align
              Telescope-&gt;Polar Axis Corr."
              from the menu. Gemini will move the mount to where the object
              should
              be if the mount were accurately polar aligned. You should adjust
              the
              polar alignment of the mount using the altitude and elevation
              knobs
              until the object is again centered in the eyepiece. Since the
              mount
              will approximate perfect polar alignment, all subsequent GoTo
              operations should result in target objects being near the center
              of
              the eyepiece. If not (for instance, because the mount's initial
              misalignment exceeded several degrees), you may repeat the
              correction
              process. Note that after using this function, the modeling
              parameters will be reset and you will need to rebuild the model by
              performing several alignments on different objects.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Permanent Setup</h3>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
              <li>The telescope can be parked at any "Home
                Position" by either the hand controller or serial control. The
                home position defaults to the CWD (Counterweight Down) position.
                The feature is accessed on the hand
                controller using the Quick Menu feature. Simply hold down the
                Menu
                button until the display shows "Park Mount!" The mount
                will then slew to the Park position. You can set any Park
                position
                by moving the mount to the desired position using the hand
                controller
                and then selecting the "Setup-&gt;Mount Parameter-&gt;Set Home
                Posit."
                Menu item.</li>
              <li>Switch off time and position are saved for warm restarting the
                system,
                convenient for permanently mounted telescopes or after a power
                loss.</li>
              <li>The pointing model will be reused after a Warm Start or a Warm
                Restart.</li>

            <p>To use this feature, ensure that the mount
              is in the CWD position before applying power. After selecting
              "Cold
              Start", simply choose an object from the database and select
              "GoTo". For even more convenience, Gemini offers a "GoTo
              Bright Star" feature, listing the commonly known bright stars
              currently above the horizon. Just select one of them, or a
              database
              object, and Gemini will slew reasonably close to the selected
              object. Use the hand controller to center the object. Now all you
              need to
              do is select the "Align Telescope" menu item and select
              "Synchronize". You can then add additional alignment stars
              as before.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>GPS Input</h3>
            <p>Gemini's Level 3 software allows the user to
              set Gemini's longitude, latitude, UTC date and UTC time from a GPS
              receiver connected to the serial port. Any GPS
              receiver can be used if it is capable of transmitting either NMEA
              0183 protocol or Garmin Textout protocol at 4800bps or 9600bps.</p>
            <p>Gemini attempts to query a GPS when it is
              powered on. You can also explicitly have it read the GPS data by
              using the "Setup-&gt;Geogr. Location-&gt;
              Query GPS Rec" menu item at any time.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Sophisticated Tracking Modes</h2>
            <p>
              Sidereal tracking follows the sky at a constant rate.</p>
            <p>Terrestrial Mode switches tracking off to allow for terrestrial
              use
              or observing geostationary satellites.</p>
            <h3>Comet/User Defined Tracking</h3>
            <p>Comets and Minor Planets follow their own
              trajectories through the Solar System. Gemini can be commanded to
              follow their movement in a variety of ways.</p>
            <p>Available on the hand controller is a
              Comet/User Defined submenu of the tracking speed selection. Once
              selected (after centering the object), a training phase can be
              started.
              Unlike training PEC, you don't have to follow the motions exactly.
              Just keep the object in the eyepiece for a sufficient amount of
              time. Finally, center it and press the menu button to end the
              training
              phase. Gemini calculates the necessary tracking rates in RA as
              well
              as in DEC and the mount will follow the object in both axes.</p>
            <p>The amount of time needed for training will
              vary with the object and the type of observation. For an object
              with
              a relatively slow and constant motion, a few minutes of training
              should be sufficient for visual observing. For photography, you
              may
              want to consider training for up to half of the intended exposure
              time. For an object that changes speed fairly quickly (such as a
              Near Earth Asteroid), shorter training sessions just before the
              observation will work best. In general however, for an object with
              relatively constant speed, the longer the training (up to 45
              minutes)
              and the more exactly the object is centered at the beginning and
              end
              of training, the better the tracking will be.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, if you know the ephemerides
              of the object, you can input the actual position and the position
              in
              1 to 255 hours together with this timespan. Gemini will set the
              tracking
              rates accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, new serial line commands have
              been added to allow the user to set his or her own RA/DEC tracking
              rates. This "User Defined Tracking" (to be used instead of
              a training phase) is useful for tracking minor planets and comets
              by
              setting the necessary rates using a computer program. For more
              information on how computer software can use these commands, see
              the Serial Line Protocol description.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Closed Loop Tracking</h3>
            <p>Gemini can be instructed to stay at, or
              slowly move to, given RA and Dec. coordinates regardless of how
              accurately the mount is polar aligned. The
              difference between the desired coordinates and the actual
              coordinates
              is checked about 22 times a second. If there is a difference,
              Gemini
              moves one step in the requested direction. This lets the telescope
              gently follow the coordinate at about 0.5x guiding speed.</p>
            <p>There are several
              applications for this advanced tracking feature:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><b>Visual observing</b>. There is no need to precisely polar
                  align the telescope for visual observing. The internal
                  pointing model is not only used for the GoTo operation, but
                  with Closed Loop Tracking also for keeping the object
                  centered.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Tracking comets or minor planets</b>. This requires a
                  connected computer sending updated coordinates whenever the
                  object coordinates change. The coordinates are to be
                  transferred with the :Sr and Sd commands. No :MS# slew command
                  is to be issued. If the use of the :MS# command cannot be
                  suppressed inside the computers software, Gemini's "Move Lock"
                  command :ML# can be employed to let Gemini ignore further :MS#
                  commands.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Gemini allows you
              to center an object with the hand controller during closed loop
              tracking without moving back to the calculated position. The
              difference between the calculated and actual position is stored
              and
              added to the new coordinates within the correction cycles.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Adaptive King Rate Tracking</h3>
            <p>Gemini Level 2 includes the option of
              constant King Rate tracking for objects at lower elevation. Level
              3
              takes this a step further by varying the tracking speed depending
              on
              the distance of the object above the horizon.</p>
            <p>You can enable the adaptive King rate using
              the "Setup-&gt;Mount Parameter-&gt;Tracking Speed-&gt;Adaptive
              King" menu
              item.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Variable Solar/Lunar Tracking Rates</h3>
            <p>Earth and Moon move in slightly elliptic
              orbits. According to Kepler's Law, the velocity changes with the
              distance from the gravitational center. Gemini calculates the
              actual
              tracking rate necessary to follow the object at the moment you
              select
              the tracking rate (considering the motion within the next hour).
              For
              the Moon, the parallax is taken into account, too.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Western Tracking Limit Warning</h3>
            <p>While tracking, an audible warning (a short
              beep about every 20 seconds) sounds some minutes before the
              western
              safety limit is reached. This gives the user an opportunity to
              close
              his camera shutter or take whatever other action is necessary.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Enhanced Search Mode Features</h3>
            <p>The Search Mode can now be accessed by
              remote control, a feature particularly useful in video astronomy.
              In
              addition, a new "Z" shaped search pattern, "Wobble
              Object," was added to assist in recognizing faint objects.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Permanent PEC with Advanced Functions</h3>
            <p>Level 3 provides a greatly enhanced set of
              PEC (Periodic Error Correction) features. Gemini L3 provides the
              following new PEC functions:</p>
            <p><b>PEC Delay Correction</b> - Advances the
              playback of PEC corrections to compensate for latency between the
              error and the correction during PEC recording.</p>
            <p><b>PEC Drift Correction</b> - Removes any
              systematic drift component from the recorded PEC data caused by
              differential refraction or polar misalignment.</p>
            <p><b>Smooth PEC Data</b> - Smoothes recorded
              PEC data to eliminate spurious corrections caused by seeing, etc.</p>
            <p><b>Average PEC Data</b> - Allows you to make
              multiple PEC training runs and average the results.</p>
            <p><b>Restore Saved Data</b> - Restores PEC
              data that has been moved to a backup buffer by a previous PEC
              command
              or an additional training run.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Bookmarks</h3>
            <p>Up to 10 bookmarks can now be placed at any
              coordinate in the sky, and Gemini's GoTo feature can slew to it.
              To
              set the bookmark, select the "RA/Dec Coordnt.-&gt;Set
              Bookmark" menu item. To have Gemini slew to the bookmark,
              select the "RA/Dec Coordnt. -&gt;GoTo Bookmark" menu item.</p>
            <p>You can overwrite old bookmarks using the
              Set Bookmark feature or add a new one as long as the maximum of 10
              (0..9) is not reached. Bookmarks are stored permanently and can
              only
              be erased by a Reset Defaults operation.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Identify function</h3>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Objects selectable for catalog, object type, magnitude.</li>
              <li>10 objects nearest the actual position are listed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <br>
            <h3>QuickMenu</h3>
            <p>A convenient and fast place to (1) change
              Gemini's Centering Speed, (2) toggle between Visual and
              Photographic
              Modes, (3) Park the OTA, and (4) Focus via an auxiliary adapter
              board. To access these functions, simply hold the menu button down
              until the options start appearing on the display. When you see the
              option you want to select, release the menu button.</p>
