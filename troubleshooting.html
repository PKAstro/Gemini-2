			external 
			micro SDcard reader/writer (normally USB device) to examine the cards contents.&nbsp; 
			Note: the only way to see the contents of the micro SDcard in the

			<ol type="I">
			<li>The current.bin file indicates that the program was programmed into the ARM processor. <br />If it had

				<img alt="" height="344" src="gemini-images/troublingshooting/inside-hcfirmware_dir.jpg" width="700" />
				</li> 
				<li>To remove and replace the micro SDcard please see:
				<a href="Removing_SDCards.html" target="_self">
				Removing Micro SDcard</a></li>
				<li>Also the micro-SDcard in the hand controller comes loose in 
				it socket.&nbsp; This is especially true of the first versions 
				of the hand controller.&nbsp; Normally simply reseating the card 
				will fix the problem.</li>
				<li>Another problem is that the RJ-12 connectors on the coiled

				replace, if you have a crimper for RJ12 connectors.&nbsp; Most 
				Home Depots, Lowes and Radio Shacks carriers the connectors and 
				crimpers.</li>
				<li>Since the GFU program has now been releases, You can also 
				try first formatting the the micro-SDcard in the hand controller 
				and then use GFU to upload all new files.&nbsp; You will 
				how-ever have to have the hand controller partially working for 
				this to work.&nbsp; To format the micro-SDcard, go to Menu --&gt; 
				HC--&gt;SDcard--&gt;Format SDcard--&gt;Select Yes.&nbsp; Wait for the 
				Format to finish.&nbsp; Then open up GFU, on on the option boxes 
				only check "HC" and "catalogs," leave Gemini and Flash 
				unchecked.&nbsp; Hit the Start button.&nbsp; When the GFU 
				routines stops, unplug the hand controller and then plug it back

			I prefer to do bench testing with motors removed from the mount.&nbsp; 
			Now you can safely run the Gemini-2 or Gemini-1 without motors, but 
			you can tell so much more with the motors connected.
			<ol type="I">
				<li> 
				You can almost test all the functions of the Gemini-2 on the bench this way.  Just about all of the pictures 
				taken for this web site was done this way.</li>
				<li> 
				Notice when first powering on, that the RA motor does not turn.&nbsp; 
				It only starts rotating after a boot mode is selected. (Assuming 
				you are in parking mode 0, more on this later.)</li>
				<li> 
				The RA motor turns CCW for GM-8 and G11.&nbsp; It turns CW for 
				HGM-200, Titan, Titan 50 and MI-250.&nbsp; The speed is about 1 
				revolution in 10 seconds, but depends on the mount type.</li>
			</ol>
		
		</li>
			<li>Testing the guider input:&nbsp; If you have a Classic/Standard 
			hand controller, this can be plugged into the Guider input jack.&nbsp; 
			You can use the DEC and RA button to then simulate Guider input 
			signals.<br />If you have a GPUSB from Shoestring Astronomy along 
			with there GPUSBNudge program to do the same thing.
			<ol type="I">
				<li>
				RA
				buttons will cause the RA shaft to slow down with an -RA button 
				and speed up with a +RA button.</li>
				<li>
				DEC buttons will cause the CW with Positive DEC (GM8 &amp; G11) and 
				CCW with negative DEC button (again GM8 &amp; G11)&nbsp; The other 
				mounts will be opposite.
				</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Testing Hand Controller input.&nbsp;
			<ol type="I">
				<li>The hand controller normally connects to the Serial Port 2 
				input jack.&nbsp; The baud rate for the hand controller is 
				always 57600 baud.&nbsp; This can only be set using the Web 
				interface using the 
				<a href="web/web-serial-ports.html" target="_self">Serial Ports tab</a>.&nbsp; Set Serial Port 2.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Will the hand controller work into Serial Port 1, Yes, but 
				you must set the baud rate of that port to 57600.&nbsp; Serial 
				port 1 will default to 9600 baud after a firmware update, so 
				having the hand controller connected to it is not the best idea.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Testing Serial Port 1 for GPS connection.&nbsp;
			<ol type="I">
				<li>
				Please see this
				<a href="GPS.html" target="_blank">page</a> 
				for using the Losmandy GPS or the Star GPS unit.</li>
				<li>
				Please note that the GPS does not update the TimeZone setting.&nbsp; 
				All GPS units only return UTC time.&nbsp; The Gemini-2 then can 
				take that time and the TimeZone value you have set using either 
				the site menu or the TimeZone menu and display your local time.&nbsp; 
				If your Timezone is set wrong, then the Gemini-2 will calculate 
				the local time wrong.&nbsp; If you do not like to worry about 
				daylight saving time changing the TimeZone requirements, then 
				set the TimeZone to UTC which would be zero.&nbsp; Enter UTC 
				Time and Date manually or use a GPS unit.&nbsp; The local time 
				now will display the UTC time and date, and the G2 will be 
				happy.&nbsp; Make sure your Latitude and Longitude are correct.</li>
				<li>
				It is possible to simulate a GPS connection using programs such as GPS port director found under useful Programs. 
				This program will allow a GPS connected to a PC to be redirected to a com port connected into the Gemini-2. Your PC
				is of course going to have to have 2 serial ports.  Now one of these can be a USB style GPS unit 
				(such as the ones that used to be supplied with Microsoft 
				Streets and Maps.&nbsp; There are also many cheap USB GPS units 
				on the market.), where it's driver
				creates a virtual serial port.  Most likely, you would have to use a USB to Serial adapter for the second serial port.</li>

					problem with this is that it normally makes the network 
					after the Laptop a Public network, which limits things.&nbsp; 
					I am not going to get into how to configure ICS here, as

			<li>
			The internal battery 
			in the main Gemini 2 unit powers both the Real Time clock and the internal CMOS-RAM both of 
			which are 
			located inside the ARM processor that is the brains of the Gemini-2.&nbsp; 
			This battery is a CR2354, and the type of holder makes it a little 
			difficult to replace in the Original Gemini-2. (<a href="javascript:localURL('videos/Losmandy_Gemini_Battery_CR2354.mp4')" target="_self">CR2354 
			battery change video</a>.)&nbsp;In the new Gemini-2 Mini the battery 
			type is a CR2450 and is much easier to change. (<a href="javascript:localURL('videos/Losmandy_Gemini_Battery_CR2450.mp4')" target="_self">CR2450 
			battery change video</a>). There is no battery in the hand 
			controller.&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms of a low or dead battery:</li>
			<ol type="I">
				<li>Not remember the site on power up, </li>
				<li>Comes up with the wrong time or date,</li>
				<li>Does not remember mount type,</li>
				<li>Model or PEC not remembered,</li>
				<li>GOTO's are erratic</li>
				<li>Forced Cold Start. </li>
				<li>There could be many other problems caused by this also.</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Replace this battery when the battery level scale shows it to be 
			2.75 volts or lower.&nbsp; You find this reading on the Web 
			interface under Battery, Ports tab. See
			<a href="web/web-battery-ports.html" target="_self">web battery, 
			ports</a> as an example.</li>
			<li class="style6Red">IMPORTANT: As soon as you have replaced the battery, 
			<em><u>Please power on the Gemini-2 and set the time and date.</u></em> If you don't it is possible 
			that the ARM processor will try and draw a lot of power from the 
			battery, and could cause internal damage.</li>
			<li class="style6"">I suggest that if you have the original Gemini-2 you
			consider changing the battery holder to the one for the CR2450.
			You can get one from 
			<a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Keystone-Electronics/1053?qs=%2fha2pyFaduhIp1yZj%252bHL4dqpQ0dEcYMmVEgfiPuLFYacWefKptt%252b9Q%3d%3d" target="_blank">Mouser Electronics Part number 534-1053-BH</a>
			It will fit in the same holes and space as the current battery holder.  You might consider using
			<a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Chip-Quik/SMD1?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtyU1cDF2RqUEx4HVIhVm2RxvaiiXwXOtA%3d" target="_blank">ChipQuik SMD Removal kit</a> which contains solder that stays molten long enough to easily remove the old
			holder very easy.  I know, I used it to change to this battery holder on my own
			Gemini-2. Of course I should not have to say if you do this, 
			you do it at your own risk. So you might want to get a TV or Computer repair shop to do it for you.</li>

			which are 
			located inside the ARM processor that is the brains of the Gemini-2.&nbsp; 
			This battery is a CR2354, and the type of holder makes it a little 
			difficult to replace in the Original Gemini-2. (<a href="javascript:localURL('videos/Losmandy_Gemini_Battery_CR2354.mp4')" target="_self">CR2354 
			battery change video</a>.)&nbsp;In the new Gemini-2 Mini the battery

			battery change video</a>). There is no battery in the hand 
			controller.&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms of a low or dead battery:</li>
			<ol type="I">
				<li>Forced Cold Start. Also this can also happen on Gemini-1 
				systems as well.</li>
				<li>Not remember the site on power up, </li>
				<li>Comes up with the wrong time or date,</li>
				<li>Does not remember mount type,</li>
				<li>Model or PEC not remembered,</li>
				<li>GOTO's are erratic </li>
				<li>There could be many other problems caused by this also.</li>
				
			</ol>
			<li>Also there is a selection menu on the hand controller "Menu 
			--&gt;Startup --&gt;Cold Start" that will force a startup in cold start.&nbsp; 
			Like wise, the Web interface also has this same selection. Also see 
			at the bottom of page
			<a href="web/web-mount.html" target="_self">
			/web/web-mount.php</a> for an example.&nbsp;It's
