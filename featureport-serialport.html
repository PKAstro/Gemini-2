		1. This page will teach you how to make a cable that can safely be 
		connected to the Feature port of the Gemini-2 telescope controller.&nbsp; 
		This cable will provide a USB to Serial virtual port into your computer.&nbsp; 
		There are drivers for many different operating systems available.&nbsp; 
		See <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm" target="_blank">
		http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm</a>&nbsp; for the different drivers, 
		including MAC OSX, Windows, Windows 8.1 and Linux.<br />2. The other thing this cable can be used for is to replace 
		the boot-loader of the main processor if anything goes really wrong, and 
		it seems like the Gemini-2 has died. now 99.9% of the time it is not the 
		boot-loader but the micro-SDcard format messed up, and this cable will 
		not fix that. So don't make the cable just for that reason, this is just 
		added information about what this cable can be used for.</td></tr>

		<strong><em>You will also have to enable the pins of the feature port

		Go into the Web interface, and go to the Battery/Ports page.&nbsp; At the

		binary so F5= Pin 6 and F4 = Pin 5.) On the Serial Port Setting page,

		You have to back the screws out to insert the wires. The wires need to be stripped about 1/8 inch.

		4-, 4+, 3-.</td></tr>
