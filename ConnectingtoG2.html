			Gemini 2 firmware can be updated using a built-in web interface.  In order to use the web 
			interface, you will need to make a network connection between Gemini and your computer.  
			Note: the Ethernet Port on the Gemini-2 is a dual speed port 
			(10/100mbits).&nbsp; This means it is either 10Mbits per second or 100 Mbits per 
			second which is determined by the device you are connecting too.&nbsp; 
			Because of this, connecting to a computer or device that has the 
			same speed liminations can be problematic. Most devices that only 
			have this speed range cannot detect what wiring an Ethernet cable 
			has.&nbsp; So if you are trying to connect the Gemini-2 to a 
			computer/laptop, that only has a 10/100 Mbits connection, the 
			connection is more than likely to fail.&nbsp; To prevent this, It takes 
			either an auto detecting Ethernet port or a 3 speed port such as&nbsp;a 
			10/100/1000 Mhz port to detect what kind of cable is being used.&nbsp; Most 
			modern routers are now what is called Gibit Routers (10/100/1000) 
			speed or auto detecting and can detect the cable type. Many of the Newer Win10 laptops 
			are also. The Gemini-2 cannot determine 
			the cable type.&nbsp; But this only has to be done on 
			one end of the cable by one GBit Device, I.E. a Gibit Computer, Router or 
			Switch.&nbsp; If your Computer, Router, or Switch is not a Gibit 
			model or auto detecting, you might have to use what is called a
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cable" target="_blank">
			cross-over</a> cable, to allow the Gemini-2 and computer to see each 
			other.<br />
			<br />
			Now we will discuss networking methods for devices to get each 
			others ID or IP address.<br />
			
			<ol><li>			
			Using a router. This is called <a href="#Network_with_DHCP:">
			Network with DHCP</a>.&nbsp; I find this the easiest method.&nbsp; 
			The router can assign the Gemini-2 an IP address, as long as the 
			base subnet address of the router is in the
				http://192.168.x.xxx range.&nbsp; If it is not, then you will have to 
				manually change the Gemini-2 IP address to match the routers 
				base Default Gateway address.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples would be change 
				the gemini-2 Default Gateway address to http://192.168.0.1, 
				which it normally defaults to.&nbsp; Some routers such as 
				Netgear brands use http://192.168.1.1 for there Default Gateway 
				so you would put the Default Gateway to 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; With 
				these setting then the router can assign an empty DHCP IP 
				address to the Gemini-2. <span class="auto-style1"><em>On any local network, no two devices 
				can have the same IP address. All devices on a network must have 
				it's own unique IP address.</em></span>&nbsp; Also note that although the Hand controller can show the
				IP address, the address shown is that of the main Gemini 2 unit.  The hand controller does not have
				it's own Ethernet connection or IP address.&nbsp; Please note: 
				Some browsers try to connect using a secure connection,&nbsp; 
				https://&nbsp; This will not work with the Gemini-2.&nbsp; It 
				has to start with http://<br /><br /></li>
			<li><a href="#The_Direct_Method">The Direct method</a>. This 
				method uses a Ethernet cable directly between you computer and 
				the Gemini-2.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has a 10/100 Mbit 
				Port, then you will have to use a Crossover cable.&nbsp; If your 
				computer has a 10/100/1000Mhz port then you can use either a 
				crossover or a standard patch cable.&nbsp; A 10/100/1000Mhz Switch or hub might also be 
				inserted into this method, and then standard patch cables can be 
				used.&nbsp; Note: A hub does not provide any method of changing IP addresses.&nbsp; 
			I would like to recommend a
			<a href="http://plugable.com/products/usb2-e1000" target="_blank">
			USB to Gigabit Ethernet adapter</a> instead of a cross-over cable if 
			your computer does not have a 10/100/1000 bit Ethernet port, and you 
			do not want to use an external hub.&nbsp; 
			This will give your computer two hardware Ethernet ports, assuming 
			your computer already has one.<br /><br />
			</li>
				<li>Here is a <a href="ethernet_connections.html">drawing of 
				these methods</a>, the top 2 illustrations are the direct method and the 
				bottom is the Router method. Now if the router or switch is 
				10/100/1000 (Gigabit) then either type of cable can be used.<br /><br /></li>
				<li>To test where a connections is working use a web browser and 
				enter the web interface by using 
				<a href="http://gemini/" target="_blank">http://gemini/</a> or 
				<a href="http://192.168.0.111/" target="_blank">http://192.168.0.111</a> or http://your gemini2's IP address,
				into the address bar of the web browser.&nbsp; A login box will should

			This is most easily done using a cross-over Ethernet cable directly 
			between Gemini’s Ethernet connector and your computer’s network 
			connector.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has a 10/100/1000Mhz port then you can 
			use either a crossover or a standard patch cable. Alternatively, you 
			can use a Gibit Ethernet hub/switch (not&nbsp; a router) and 
			standard cables between Gemini and the hub/switch and between your computer 
			and the hub.<br />
			<br />
			IP Address: In order to successfully communicate with your computer 
			over the network, the Gemini 2 unit must have an IP address on the same subnet as the computer.  
			There are several ways to do this depending on how you connect Gemini to a network.  
			The following sections describe these methods.
			<br />
			<br />
			If 
			you use a direct Ethernet cable to directly connect your computer to Gemini, you’ll 
			need to assign both the computer’s Ethernet port and Gemini-2 to IP addresses on the same 
			subnet by hand.  This assumes that your computer is not running a DHCP server on the network port.  
			By default, if Gemini doesn’t get an IP address assigned by DHCP, it will use its stored 
			value (<a href="http://192.168.0.111/" target="_blank">192.168.0.111</a>) by default).&nbsp; 
			I know of no computer that can assign attached devices a DHCP 
			address unless you have set it up for
			<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/using-internet-connection-sharing#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank">

					The address should be in the form 192.168.0.xxx where xxx
