		<td class="style6"> I only know of three GPS receivers specially made for 
		the Gemini Series for mount controllers. I have also listed two 
		alternatives to actual GPS receivers connected into the Gemini-2 at the 
		bottom of this page.<br />
		<br />
		What Information does the GPS receiver provide:<br />
		1. Longitude<br />
		2. Latitude (the Gemini-2 uses this to determine Northern or Southern 
		Hemisphere automatically.)<br />
		3. Time/date in UTC&nbsp; (All GPS receivers only provide time in UTC/date 
		and does not provide local time/local date to the 
		Gemini-2.&nbsp; Now if you have the Timezone set correctly, including 
		daylight saving time, then the Gemini-2 can calculate the local time/date and 
		display it on the hand controller.&nbsp; If the timezone is set to zero 
		then the Gemini-2 will display UTC Time/Date on the hand controller. Either 
		way, the Gemini-2 will calculate proper star positions.&nbsp; It will do 
		so, even if the timezone is set incorrectly if using a GPS.&nbsp; All 
		that matters is that the Gemini-2 have the correct UTC Time and Date, 
		Longitude and Latitude which it gets from the GPS Satellites.)<br />
		4. Where the GPS data is valid or not, and if not valid, the data is not 
		used.<br />
		<br />
			Losmandy makes only the GPS receiver for the Gemini-2, the one for the Gemini-1 
		has been discontinued. You can see the one for Gemini-2 
			on <a href="http://www.losmandy.com/access.html" target="_blank">
			Losmandy Accessory Page</a>. This is a picture of the 
			Gemini-2 Version.<br /><img alt="" height="450" src="/images/hi-rez-images/GPS_2a.jpg" width="900" />
			&nbsp;The one for the Gemini-1 has a 
			part number of GCC, and the one for the Gemini-2 has a part number 
			of GCC-2. Please note that the GPS for the Gemini-1 will not work on the Gemini-2
			<ul><li>If you are really good at modifying cable, there are 
				instruction in Gemini-2 Users group in 
				<a href="https://groups.io/g/Gemini-II/message/5225" target="_blank">message 5225</a>.  that tells 
				how to modify the Gemini-1 GPS for use on the Gemini-2. I take no responsibility and you do this modification at your own risk.  
				I don't have either version, so no instruction are given here, and I cannot and have not tested the modifications.</li></ul>
