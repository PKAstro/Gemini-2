		<br />This is what the current version of the High Torque motor looks like.
		<br /> This motor is reported to have higher torque than any previous motor.<br />
	The part number is SVM-HT and can be ordered from
	<a href="http://www.losmandy.com/replacement.html" target="_blank">here</a> 
	Current price is $220.00USA.<br />
		This motor is 2.810" (71.37mm) long with a shaft diameter of 0.1250" 
		(3.18MM).
	Also notice that this motor is larger in diameter that the Maxon motor was. 
	That is the reason that the fins only come down about 50% of the motor (5 
		fins total). The 
	mounting disk on all three motors are designed to fit the Gemini Servo 
	Gearbox.
	These motors do not include the Gemini Servo Gearbox, so if you need that it 
	must be ordered separately. See image
		<a href="http://www.losmandy.com/hi-rez-images/SVGB.jpg">here.</a> 
		Also make sure you ask for the mounting screws, as the ones for previous motors will not work in this motor, 
		they are too long.&nbsp; Also the screw length to mount them is 15mm of 
		thread.&nbsp; The 15 mm length does not include the head size.<br />

		Be advised that Scott Losmandy has the cases for all the motors he uses
