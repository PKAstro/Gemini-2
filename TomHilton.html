							This page is dedicated to <b>Thomas S. Hilton</b>, in recognition of all his contributions
							to the amateur astronomy community.<br><br>
							Tom single-handedly created Gemini-2.com website, authored all the content, and maintained
							it as a free
							service. His selflessness, and willingness to help others made our hobby better in all
							respects. He helped countless newbies become experts, and gave his time freely
							to anyone who needed it.

							This updated site is a dedication to his life's work in astronomy and a loving memory of a
							man who touched and improved so many lives.
						</p>
						<p>
							Tom was born in Florida and raised in Mississippi. He joined the USAF shortly
							after starting college. He was a Viernam veteran and shortly after serving there he
							went to Korea where he met his wife Sun Cha. Together they had 2 children: daughter,
							Christine; son, Timothy. He also has 4 grandchildren: Geoff, Kyle,Trystan, Seraphim,
							2 great granchildren: Temperance and Hope. Thomas always loved science and music. He
							spent much of his time doing astronomy in his later years. He was a great man and
							always there if you needed him. He is greatly missed by the whole astronomy community. </p>
