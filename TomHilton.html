									This page is a dedication to <b>Thomas S. Hilton</b>, in recognition for all his contribution to the amateur astronomy community.<br><br>
									Tom single-handedly created Gemini-2.com website, authored all the content and maintained it as free
									service. His selflessness, and willingness to help others made our hobby better in all respects. He helped countless newbies become experts, and gave his time freely 
									to anyone who needed it.

									This updated site is a dedication to his life's work in astronomy and a loving memory of a man who touched and improved so many lives.

									Tom was born in Florida and raised in Mississippi. He joined the USAF shortly
									after starting college. He was a Viernam veteran and shortly after serving there he
									went to Korea where he met his wife Sun Cha. Together they had 2 children: daughter,
									Christine; son, Timothy. He also has 4 grandchildren: Geoff, Kyle,Trystan, Seraphim,
									2 great granchilren: Temperance and Hope. Thomas always loved science and music. He
									spent much of his time doing astronomy in his later years. He was a great man and
									always there if you needed him. He is greatly missed by the whole astronomy community. </p>
