			<td class="style6"><br/>1. When disassembling the hand controller, 
			be forewarned that the gasket that is between the LCD and top 
			plastic cover sometimes sticks to the LCD. If it does stick, this 
			can be very strong, and several have broken their screen trying to get it unstuck, or pulled the LCD off the base PCB that it is mounted to. The best 
				way to remove the top cover after removing the 4 screws is to gently push down on the LCD 
				glass while slowing loosing the top cover, separating the glass from the gasket.&nbsp;See
			<a href="http://www.losmandy.com/GeminiHC.m4v" target="_blank">Movie 
			on how to open up the HC in MP4 format.</a> 
			Putting the Hand Controller in a warm place also might help loosen 
			the gasket. If you place it in direct sunlight, turn the LCD down, 
			so that the sunlight is not shining on it. Direct sunlight can 
			damage LCD's.&nbsp; I cannot give enough of a strong warning about 
			taking the hand controller apart.&nbsp; This is especially true if 
			you do not live in the USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you live in the USA and 
			feel that the hand controller must be taken apart, call Losmandy and 
			see if they are willing to do it for you.&nbsp; <br />
			There are now 2 different versions of that hand controller.&nbsp; 
			The first one is internally referred to at Losmandy referred to as BlueScreen 
			version.&nbsp; This document deals with that version.&nbsp; I found 
			out today July 12, 2013 that a newer version has been shipping and 
			about 200 of them have shipped.&nbsp; The micro SD card holder in 
			that hand controller is the same type as in the main units 
			motherboard.&nbsp; It does use the same size LCD, and suppose to have 
			non-stick Gaskets, and I think no hidden buttons at the bottoms of 
			the LCD.&nbsp; It was designed by Losmandy, and is not quite as 
			dependent on manufactures dropping the manufacture of LCD screens as 
			the older BlueScreen version was.&nbsp; This was a necessary change 
			because the manufacture of the BlueScreen LCD module stopped 
			producing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I don't have that version yet, I 
			cannot tell you more about it.</td>

			<td class="style6"><br/>2. Also while apart, there are icons at the bottom of the 
				LCD screen. They are touch sensitive. If you are touching any of these while you apply 
				power to the LCD module, or hand controller the hand controller will not boot. The 
				gasket can also cause this same effect if pushing on these icons to hard. In later 
				units this gasket has been shaved a few hundredâ€™s of a mm to prevent this.

			<td class="style6"><br/>3. If you remove the front panel of the main Gemini unit, do 
				not plug the motor cables into the unit. Sideways pressure on the motor connectors can 
				break them. The front panel	provides the mechanical stability to keep this from happening. 
				You can safely power up the Gemini 2 without motors connected. You might receive motor 
				lag messages, but that is normal, when no motors are connected. 
			You can stop this by using the Track menu and select "Terrestrial"

			<td class="style6">The micro-SDcards supplied by Losmandy are 2GB cards

			Use the default Fat size for the 2Gbyte size of micro-SDcards to 
			format them.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4GB is the maximum size but has not been tested by the writer of the 
			firmware. If using 4GB micro-SDcards, they MUST be formatted using
